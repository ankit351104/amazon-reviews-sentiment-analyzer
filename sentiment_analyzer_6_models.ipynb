But he spends far too much time repeating military jargon, repetitiously identifying every spot on the Viet Nam map, and using the book as a forum to name countless comrades who fought with him in Nam. The recurring names do nothing for the story except serve to detract. And the cruelest cut of all may be indicative of his poor research when, on page 166, he disparagingly refers to a vist to the troops by Jane Mansfield and describes her as \\\\\"\"an aging American icon..who had to be in her late forties or early fifties at the time.\\\\\"\" For your unfortunate information, Mr. Culbertson, Jane Mansfield died in 1967 at the ripe old age of 34 years, 2 months and 10 days, hardly what I would call an \\\\\"\"aging\\\\\"\" time.

It was still cheaper than ordering from the coffee shop, but much more expensive than a cup of coffee!<br /><br />I was hesitant about ordering this because of the negative reviews, but figured, worst case scenerio, I could alway use the powder for baking if it was undrinkable as some others were saying. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and was greeted with a bright green powder that smelled very similar to the higher end bag I had sitting next to it on the counter. I made an iced latte following the same recipe I use every morning (1tsp matcha with a dash of cane sugar and agave nectar and water, plus a splash of milk). The end result was pretty similar! I would say this powder resulted in a slightly more bitter drink overall, but that could easily be remedied with a bit more sweetener. I don't like using a lot of sweetener in my drink, so I'll continue to drink them as is. The difference is so minute that it is pretty much a non issue.<br /><br />My only complaint is the packaging. It is completely SKETCH. There is no ingredient list, organic certification, country of origin, etc... It makes me a bit nervous.<br /><br />That being said, I will most likely order again once this bag runs out. I'm hopeful that the quality of the next bag will be on par with the first!\n",

Zevia sodas not only give me the ability to drink sodas again because of the zero sugar, but it's a great healthy alternative when you are trying to slim down, and now that they got rid of the coloring things cant get any better than that! I've tasted a majority of the Zevia flavors when they weren't clear and the cream soda as my absolute favorite, and now that it's clear this soda just keeps getting better. I see that people are saying it lost the taste it once had but my experience was quite the opposite, and I thought it tasted the exact same, or even better than the original!

            "Review: OK Review update. This batch of Shiraz was started on 10/7/15. I went right by the instructions except for the addition of 1 tsp of L D Carlson yeast nutrient per gallon. Starting S G was 1.084. On 10/12/15 the S G was down to 0.996 so I racked it into the secondary fermenter. I follow an old fashion method from here. Every day after the first rack I rack it back to the primary and check the SG. Todays S G was 0.994 so it is still working. Then I clean out the carboy secondary and rack the wine back into it, This process has two benefits, first it removes a lot of the fines that need to be out and second it removes a lot of the CO2. This makes it easier to stabilize and clarify. I do this daily until I get 3 days without any change of the S G. At that point it is ready for the final steps before bottling. Oh what I use for a S G test goes into a glass for sipping. If it tastes like vinegar you can stop and bottle it for use as wine vinegar because it will never be fit for drinking.inted with to small of a font making it hard for old folks to read. Second they gave me some nice wine labels for my bottles but no corks or sleeves,But all in all for a budget priced kit is is pretty good and the Shiraz is a smooth wine that will go well with any meal.\n",

I tend to avoid consuming any energy beverages  on a daily basis for fear of addiction or creation of energy slumps, but this product is a perfect portion and easily compliments any lunch purchased or prepared. It fits easily into any one's routine. It provides a serving of fruits and vegetables. In one can you're getting a serving of 100 percent juice wlong with the same amount if caffine as a cup of coffee (8oz). It delivers a healthy dose of energy without  leaving me in a slump after consuming it.  With a new child in my household I don't have time to feel grogy and I enjoy any extra support (energy, and nutritional). I wouldnt recommend consumption for nursing mothers without consulting their doctor, which is stated on the can (not for pregnant or nursing women).  Great flavor. Great boost of energy.

On the days that the pump won't be used, I recommend covering the pump opening with plastic food wrap to avoid the sauce from drying out and clogging the opening. This has happened several times, but it's no biggie -- I just use a sharp knife to scrape out the dried sauce.<br /><br />My only problem with this is the pump. It doesn't reach the bottom of the container. For the last couple inches of syrup left, I have to pour it out. Sometimes I pour too much and white mocha overload, sometimes I pour too little and don't get my white mocha fix, and sometimes I don't pour at all because I'm in a rush to get to work. :\\\n",

I don't buy candy bars due to all the sugar / carbs ... but at only 5g sugar in the dark chocolate version of the Kind bar, and fiber to help counter the rest of the carbs (16 carbs / 7 fiber), I decided to give these a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I think they are delicious and they are, for the most part, a guilt-free snack option for me that completely satisfying any craving I have for sweets.  Much better than eating an actual candy bar.  I will definitely buy these again.\n",

            "Review: I wasn't pleased with this product.  Sometimes for the purposes of testing food products we are given multiple units.  In this case, I am glad I only got one.  This is a case of an interesting concept that is poorly executed.<br /><br />The meal itself, if it can be called that, is a kind of soupy rice with bits of spices in it. The spice level is mild.  However, there was almost no meat in the contents of this package.  Hard to call it &#34;chicken and rice&#34; without meat; it should have been called &#34;chicken flavored rice.&#34;<br /><br />As many others have noted, the nutritional content of this kind of meal is bound to be lacking.  I won't beat a dead horse.  All I can say is that I did not think this tasted &#34;salty&#34; to me considering the higher than normal sodium content.<br /><br />My plan was to add this on top of plate of rice to put all of that good sauce to use.  But that's the biggest problem with this.  Comparing the rice in this pouch to the rice I mixed with it, this rice is pure mush.  I just don't think that things like rice and pasta can be pre-cooked effectively.<br /><br />This is a product that will not be added to my shopping list.  I recommend you avoid it.\n",

I knew getting rid of an unnecessary ingredient would be a good thing but I was a little afraid that I wouldn't like the taste anymore.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />The new clear Zevia tastes even better than the original. It was a little weird pouring the soda in a glass and being able to see through it but I love the flavor. Now I can feel even better about drinking this amazing beverage.

The only way I could think to get a good idea of how much energy this really gives was to replace my Monday morning coffee with this drink.  I expected to be groggy and running on empty all day, but was super impressed by how I felt.  I was awake, alert, and had plenty of energy to get me through the day.  Assuming it was a fluke, I again replaced my morning coffee with V8 Energy the next couple of days with similar results.  I have purchased several of these 6-packs since initially trying it, and will continue to do so.<br /><br />There are two flavors of the diet version of this drink, and I have tried both of them.  The cranberry flavor is pretty good; it tastes a little bit like watered down cranberry juice but not in a bad way.  The strawberry lemonade flavor isn't the best.  I drank all six of them, and would drink it again if I didn't have a choice, but I won't go so far as to say it tastes good.  Plus, it's a weird not-found-in-nature yellow color when I poured it into a glass and that put me off.<br /><br />Finally, I really like they they only have 3 carbs per can, which is awesome for my low-moderate carb lifestyle.  Overall, I give these 5 stars!<br /><br />**I received this product for free from BzzAgent in exchange for a review**\n",

Here is my background. 5&#34;2 123lbs when started, in nursing school so I sit all day long at the study desk, tried to work out some but have no time let say I workout twice a week 30 mins each. Eat right not completely healthy and not as bad neither since I love food too much. Here is my result:<br />- 1st day, I had a bowel movement immediately 30 mins after drinking the tea. It was semifluid and its definitely cleansed out my entire colon cause I didnt have another bowel movement for the next 5 days.<br />- it didnt keep me awake like some other tea, sometimes I'd drank it at 5pm just so I could study but nah, not on my body.<br />- definitely suppressed my taste bud for sure, as I'm a food lover and always crave for food. I noticed I dont really want anything.<br />- give me energy for sure cause I know usually when it comes to final weeks my body get so stressed out that all it wanted to do is sleep. But with this tea, I was fine.<br />- my waist was 33in when I started and I measured it this morning (even I had a big dinner last night) it is now 30in<br />- I've gained 10lbs since the past 6 months and started at 123lbs and today and 120lbs<br />- and the tea lasted me 2 week and a half.<br />- will I continue trying this product? yes! I honestly didnt expect it to work since I'm small not heavy weight and it's hard to loose weight when you dont have that much to loose.

Also, while the ingredients seem fine, he had a GI reaction that he experiences when he has gluten or dairy, so we wondered if there was possible cross contamination in the manufacturing process?  Just to be safe we passed them along to a military friend and he loves them!!  He is getting 5-6 hrs of energy boost and does not feel a crash at all!

If you lack in experience, blame you.  When I visit the South Louisiana hometown of my wife even the Cajuns say they're not going to stir (or burn) roux for an hour any more.  They are changing to this particular bottled roux.  One of the most famous Cajun restaurants in Lafayette, Louisiana, has Savoie's making bulk roux for them....  However, it's your dollar.  For six bucks, give it a try....\n",

No washing coffee cups or waiting in line at the local coffee shop, just grab a bottle and run. In terms of calories and sugar, the light is where it's add. The standard Mocha is good but it's very thick and I feel like the heavy sugar and cream upset my stomach. The light is just the right amount of sweetness and compared to other brands like SkinnyCow and Gevalia it contains significantly fewer calories and sugar. The light vanilla is also pretty good, but the mocha is my favorite for sure.<br /><br />In my local grocery store I can usually get these for about $1 a bottle on sale.\n",

I did the math and realized that it would take me much longer to run out of onion powder and that I would be paying much less per ounce. My only question was, &#34;Would it be as good as what I had been using?&#34; Once I used it I discovered that not only was it as good, but perhaps it was even a little better.

            "Review: 40 years ago, Chef Boyardee pizza kit in a box was the first pizza anyone in my family had ever had.  Hubby and I were both latchkey kids, and one of the things we always loved was when our parents would buy us the Chef-Boyardee pizza kits in the boxes to make our lunches or dinners with.  We were talking about how much we loved the sauce, and I thought it would be a neat surprise to be able to make pizza like that again for him.  Now, I can make great pizza these days, and can certainly make my own sauce, usually just using crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and garlic, which is WAY more healthy than this, but it was that old taste I was after.<br />This is it.  It's like the long thin cans that used to be in the kits.  Did anyone else stick their finger in to get the left over sauce on the sides?<br /><br />I used a wet pizza dough, stiffened up a bit with some flour kneaded in-  see [[ASIN:B000XPNUPY Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]], stretched it out square on a cooking pan I'd sprayed, and topped it liberally with this sauce, pepperoni if you want it , lots of parmesan cheese (NO MOZZARELLA to get the OLD taste).  I cooked it at 425 on the TOP rack (usually I'd cook pizza hotter and lower, but it was the OLD taste of being 13 and not knowing better I was after...)  It came out a PERFECT reproduction- it was exactly like our preteen pizzas at a fraction of the cost, and I like to think using fresh dough and good quality cheese without preservatives bumps the health factor up a notch or two from the original boxed kits.<br /><br />One can makes 2 big saucy pizzas.\n",

Literally the very first morning I had this (mixed about a teaspoon of it into yogurt kefir), I had sustained energy all the way through the end of the day. That was nearly 2 months ago, and I've barely gone a day without having some since. I only wish it tasted better, but that's not the company's fault- that's just Maca from what I understand. Tastes almost like a sickeningly semi-sweet version of a type of brown sugar (but again, only semi-sweet). That's the best I can describe it. I simply tolerate it, it's not something I look forward to tasting. I do love this brand though, Vita Labs. I get their raw cacao powder too, and it's fantastic.\n",

I saw that one of your customers used this for her acne & she saw improvement. So, I purchased it in hopes that it would do the same for my daughter. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. The only thing that helps is 100% CBD Oil, which is very expensive, but worth it so that my daughter doesn't have acne scars. She does like this product for her skin in general, as she says it makes her skin very soft. Fast shipping, great seller! It just didn't work for her acne.\n",

            "Review: The problem with flax is that it contains a huge amount of phytoestrogen - more than three times as much as soy, and far more than any other food that I am aware of.  Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring components of many plant foods.  They mimic estrogen, a female sex hormone.  From what I have read, estrogens or phytoestrogens reduce the masculine characteristics of males and increase the ovarian and breast cancer risk in females.  Don't take my word for it, do your own research, and watch out for the industry-sponsored web sites with disinformation that promote sales of soy products.  They will tell you that phytoestrogens and isoflavones are good for you.<br /><br />I used the product in smoothies for several months because I didn't know any better and because flax contains useful Omega 3 oils.  No complaints about quality.  I dropped it because I don't need anything messing with my testosterone.\n",

I literally had to use a sharp tool to chisel out a chunk. (See pics)<br />I would suggest, perhaps, contacting the seller before ordering and ask how they will ship it. Mine arrived in a simple box. Hence, the reason I recieved a chocolate brick instead of individual choc covered almonds. The product itself is wonderful but absolutely addicting. So be careful.

            "Review: You decide on the flavor and types of teas you like. I cannot guide you with that. I prefer Black tea the most, followed by White, then Green. I find Green is just the most bitter, and Black tea goes down the smoothest. I also drink coffee every morning so the caffeine doesn't bother me. Black tea contains the most caffeine so I like that too.<br />I love this tea brand. I originally discovered it about 3 years ago also on Amazon.com. I buy fair trade and organic coffee, but I always just purchased store brand teas. And I said to my self, 'well why can't i find a fair trade and/or organic tea as well'?<br />So the search was started. It ended at Amazon.com (also where it began) and with this brand of tea. I had never heard of it before. After doing research this was the brand for me. The tea is manufactured with renewable energy and the teas are fair trade and organic which makes a better tea. Also, the tea bags do not contain any staples. I never noticed any metal flavor from any tea bag that had a staple, but their design is nice and more practical. They tie the string in a unique way to close off the tea bag which I am just fascinated by. I have never seen anything like it. The bags are not brown and unbleached, but they are not bleached bright white like most main stream manufacturers.<br />Pure peppermint tea, nothing else. You cannot get much better than this. If you love mint or just are not feeling well this tea is great for you. Since it is an herb tea, it does not contain caffeine. Again, it is also fair trade and organic which I don't know about you, but that is important to me and what I consume.\n",

            "Review: Update 2:<br /><br />Bummer, Zevia. Don't know if it's a bad batch or a new tweaking to the taste, but I just bought several 6-packs that have a very aggressive and different flavor. (All of the cans have the same batch number.) It's like one of the ingredients got increased significantly, but not in balance with the other flavors. Whatever it is, within seconds of drinking it, my stomach hurts and my head feels really fuzzy (new). The product is just too expensive for this kind of issue. Really disappointed.<br /><br />Update 1:<br /><br />Spurred by the formula change, I stopped drinking Zevia cola for three weeks (substituting with canned sparkling water -- this really helped with the transition). Wanting a little caffeine during the day, I started drinking Zevia again (although at a much reduced amount). Here are positives I discovered with the new formula:<br /><br />-- Clear -- love this for the reduction of staining to teeth<br /><br />-- Taste -- I adjusted to the new taste and like it. A big positive is that the taste &#34;holds&#34; even when the soda gets warm and slightly flat. I find that I drink the entire can now (making the supply last longer). Also, the formula is still aggressive on an empty stomach, so I tend to only drink it with a full meal (also making the supply last longer).<br /><br />With this transition, I now drink less soda but enjoy / savor it as a treat even more. Yay!<br /><br />***<br /><br />This is the first review of a product I've ever posted on Amazon. I was delighted to find Zevia a few years ago, and it helped in transitioning off of diet cola with aspartame. (Cutting out that kind of drink really made a difference in eating healthier foods more easily; I did not have the same &#34;ghost&#34; hunger and cravings for chips, sweets, etc.) I drink a lot of diet soda, and I've wondered how and if I ever would stop drinking. After tasting the new version of the Zevia Cola, I think--with disappointment, but also gratitude--it may be today.<br /><br />The new version has a dominant Sprite-like, citrus taste, with a kind of peppery, metallic undertone (perhaps that's the &#34;cola&#34; flavor). It's like a cross between Dr. Pepper, Sprite, and Diet Coke, health-foods style. It's more aggressive on the stomach. &#34;Natural flavors&#34; is listed higher on the ingredient list on the cans now (although it's listed last on the Zevia website).<br /><br />Even while writing this post, I continued to take sips, hoping each time I would like it, because diet soda is my staple (like coffee is for many). But it's just too non-Cola, citrus-y, with a bit of heart-burn-like kickback. I can't believe I may no longer be a soda drinker!<br /><br />I really appreciate Zevia for providing a product that helped me transition off diet cola with aspartame, and for offering alternatives for those who drink full-sugar versions of Cola. While bummed, I am grateful for this latest tweak because it's time for me to stop (or at least significantly reduce) my soda consumption.today.<br /><br />The new version has a dominant Sprite-like, citrus taste, with a kind of peppery, metallic undertone (perhaps that's the &#34;cola&#34; flavor).

            "Review: So I took some time before writing this review to try every suggestion listed in the comments to make this coffee taste good.  I originally tried my tried and true drip (tasteless), then I doubled the amount of coffee (still blah).  I tried multiple cups hoping that the beans deeper in the bag would be better.<br /><br />Today was the final test after purchasing a french press and a burr grinder.  I measured everything exactly, pre-heated the beaker, got the water just below boiling, brewed for 3 1/2 minutes, used just a pinch of sugar (tasteless).  Then I doubled the amount and brewed for 4 minutes.  The final cup was better, but still top 5 worst cups of coffee I've ever had.  I did not try using an aeropress, but I can't think it will make much of a difference.<br /><br />I will give two stars because it didn't kill me, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this coffee.  I also haven't found any screws in the bag.  Starbucks tastes burnt to me.  This coffee has the same flavor, so if that's what you like, then this coffee is for you.  For me, it tastes like what I imagine the bottom of a shoe tastes like after walking through a gas station bathroom.<br /><br />I'm sure that the troll who keeps downvoting any negative reviews of this coffee will visit me shortly after I post this.<br /><br />I would have preferred to purchase only a 1lb bag, but the option wasn't available at the time of purchase.  I see that has changed.  The resealable tape on the bag sucks.  I'm stuck with a huge bag of coffee that I can only use to pelt children who walk on my lawn.\n",

            "Review: I enjoy having a chance to try variety packs -- it's the best way to try new flavors without ending up with a big box of a flavor you may not like.  The Java Factory Variety Pack  K-cup coffee pack contains:<br />7 - <B>Wakey Wakey</B> - Since these are light roast and have a bit more caffeine than medium or dark roast and a lighter flavor it's good for breakfast or whenever you need a pick me up and a flavor to not over-power your food.<br />8 - <B>Smooth Caffeinator&#60;//B&#62; - Medium Roast with a smooth flavor bold but not harsh.<br />8 - <B>Dark & Handsome</B> - dark roast with bolder flavor than <B>Smooth Caffeinator</B>.<br />7 - <B>Da Bomb</B> - dark roast with double caffeine.  This one has the boldest flavor but not a burnt taste.  It also stands up very nicely to strongly flavored (sugar-free) syrups such as Raspberry and Gingerbread.  Without or without creamer or flavor syrup it was a nice strong cup of coffee.<br />NOTE: I mostly drink my coffee black now-a-days since I&#34;m cutting back on calories and creamers even the low calories one have just too many calories for me.  The three bolder flavored coffees didn't taste burnt to me as many with 'bold' or 'robust' flavors seem to do lately.  Cream in my coffee is for after dinner with dessert.<br />6 - <B>Vanilla Dream</B> - This one was a bit of a surprise.  Nice nutty buttery flavor over the coffee and really, the aroma was heavenly.  Make it and don't drink it the smell is enticing enough to bring a smile.<br />4 - <B>Choconut</B> - Wow.  Finding a chocolate flavor coffee that actually has a hint of chocolate flavor has been a bit of a grab bag lately.  Tried lots but this one is so far the top contender and it has a nice coconut flavor also.  With creamer it's like drinking a liquid Mounds candy bar (used Sweet Italian Cream no sugar creamer).<br /><br />All in all a great selection.  I'm definitely going to have to try more of the <B>Choconut</B> flavor especially once colder weather gets here.It will be a nice warm treat of a drink.<br /><br />If you check out Google for getting around DRM in the Keurig 2.0 these k-cups work very well and make excellent coffee.\n",

I mix a few sprinkles of these with a jar of crunchy Barney butter and then use a cookie dough scoop to make a ball I then roll it in Bob's Red Mill unsweetened coconut and freeze for an hour then keep in airtight bag or container in fridge and have one or 2 balls between 3 and 4 in the afternoon when my energy starts to diminish. This will not make an overly sweet ball, but the crunch and good flavor and nutrients help my mind to wake up as well as my body. Hope this helps, dear reader...\n",

It's very grainy and doesn't dissolve even in hot water, I had tried it in a cup with hot water not boiling but hot enough to make anything melt and these are disgusting. Right out of the package it looked clumpy, it seems as though they weren't dry enough to be made into powder. I get that these are not roasted but at least let them dry out before packaging, there's always air drying or sun drying alternatives. This is the worst powdered product I've ever had. After drinking this, it still feels as though little bits of grainy residues stuck in my throat. This is not a smooth drink, it's better to drink it in smoothies.\n",

It is nice looking but I'm sorry I bought it.\n",

I usually don't get motion sick on cruise ships, but I do get air sick on the flight to the cruise.  We're also going with two other couples, so I wanted to bring something along that could alleviate nausea for them.  I frequently use [[ASIN:B000K7B5FC Anti-Nausea Ginger Gum 24 Count]] for long car rides, but the problem with gum is that you eventually have to spit it out and throw it away.  That's not always easy to do (the throwing away part) when you're walking around in another country.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of candied ginger because I've had some that absolutely burned.  I don't know about the just ginger flavor of these candies, but the apple flavor is amazing.  Yes, the ginger flavor is very spicy, so if you're sensitive to that kind of sensation, ginger might not be for you, but the apple flavor makes this really tasty!<br /><br />Ginger works really well to alleviate nausea for me.

            "Review: This is by far the best hot sauce I've found for Cajun food and my general (and frequent) hot sauce indulgences.  Frankly, most of the others are just peppery goo.  Melinda's doesn't use corn starch fillers.  Instead there is a base of natural vegetables including primarily carrots, but you really can't taste the carrots.  In the hotter varieties (XXXX and XXX), there are more habaneros and proportionately less carrots.  There is also onion and garlic for flavor.  Unlike other hot sauces, this isn't a thin vinegary sauce.  It's a full bodied sauce with dense flecks of ground habanero peppers.  There is salt and vinegar, which provide a good flavor and also serve as natural preservatives.  This is a HOT sauce, but the heat is from the delicious habanero peppers, and not from added citric acid (hot without flavor) like others.  The wonderful habanero pepper is the dominant presence, as it should be.  When I make my own hot sauce, my goal is to recreate Melinda's XXXX, but lately I just buy it instead.  Great stuff!  I think the 365 day recommended shelf life is based on the time required for the XXXX to dissolve the glass bottle.  :-)  My mouth is watering and my scalp is sweating just from the fond memories I relived while writing this review.  Also recommended as a home remedy whenever you need a fast acting all-natural decongestant... that's delicious!\n",

            "Review: It's unfortunate that the vendor does not state that this TVP product is completely UNFLAVORED otherwise, I believe the reviews would be better.  Most vegan / vegetarians familiar with buying TVP expect the package to denote whether the product is flavored or not.  When you buy TVP that is labeled &#34;chicken&#34; or &#34;beef&#34;, etc. you expect it to be seasoned to mimic those tastes.  If it's unflavored, as this product is, it is typically labeled as such because you're expected to decide what you want it to taste like and then, season it yourself.  I purchased this product in its &#34;chunk&#34; form (not actually these dish-shaped strips - which actually aren't strips, at all) and cooked up a batch and was very pleasantly surprised at the authentic texture - but again, was disappointed that it was completely unseasoned.  After a quick fix with a serving of McKay's &#34;chicken&#34; seasoning and a dab of soy sauce, this made a very satisfying chicken-like product that holds together well and can be added to pasta dishes, soup or stews successfully.\n",

Fair Warning:  If you've never had microwave Pork Rinds, and only had bagged pork rings, you'll be in for a surprise.  These taste so great, I don't think I'll ever go back to the bagged pork rinds.  They are a bit salty, but they have good seasoning, and good flavor.<br /><br />We used to buy bags of of Pork Rinds from the local store, and occasionally you'd find the random hair still attached to the Pork rind.  My wife, who is rather squeamish about animal products, basically refused to eat the local stores bagged rinds because of this.  After the 3rd or 4th bag of these that I made, they smelled so good she had to try them.  She's back onto eating Pork Rinds again.  And so far she hasn't found any random hairs on the bags she's ate.<br /><br />Do make sure you read the instructions and realize that they are not the same as popcorn when microwaving.  They don't pop, except when you take them out, and then it's more of a sizzling.<br /><br />The portion is just about perfect, not too many, not too little.  Perfect sized snack.\n",

The flavors are as follows:<br /><br />I AM................................Sage, Ginger & Elderflower<br />IN THE MOOD................Hibiscus, Orange & Pepper<br />SANCTIFY..................... Ginger, Fennel & Cinnamon<br />LOVING.........................Green Tea, Cinnamon & Earl Grey<br />TALK TO ME..................Lavender, Licorice & Mint<br />DELIGHTED...................Ginger & Lemon<br />TOUCH THE GROUND...Honeybush, Aniseed & Sage<br />EMOTIONAL DETOX......Sweet Hibiscus & Mint<br />PURITY FLAME..............Sweet Choco & CHili<br />LIFE ON WINGS.............Fennel, Cardamom & Orange<br />JOYFUL SILENCE..........Apple & Lemon<br />HARMONY......................Chai Classic (no black tea)<br /><br />Several of the flavors were familiar to me but there were some combinations that were new........ pleasing but new.  In listing the ingredients, there were trace amounts of other spices and herbs such as cloves, tumeric root, lemon juice, lavender flowers, lemon grass, spearmint, coriander, blackberry leaf, nettle, rose petals, hops, orange peel, basil, fenugreek, yarrow flower, lemon verbena, raspberry leaves , etc.  The one that I was really surprised about was the black pepper.

I always use a spoonful of our wonderful local honey in my tea, but with these, I took several sips first so that I could experience the full flavor.  The only one that I didn't really care for was In The Mood only because it had 5% black pepper and pepper really bothers my throat.  But all the others were good.  This is a nice wide variety of flavors to be enjoyed morning, noon or night.<br /><br />I received this Magic Box in exchange for an honest review and honest is what I have been.for an honest review and honest is what I have been.\n",

            "Review: The product is very good but the picture is misleading!<br />As of the time of this review, the photo on Amazon is misleading. I will first deal with the product itself:<br />Aqua Glaze is a very difficult product to find. It is fairly unique in a market dominated by DAP glazing compound which is an oil base product. Aqua Glaze is water based as the name implies. There are advantages on both sides of the fence,  but Aqua Glaze is a much easier product to work with. It goes on a lot more smoothly, and can be smoothed out  with a wet putty knife. One obvious advantage is that it can be painted about an hour after application. Dap suggests 3 weeks or more., When you are painting, most painters don't have that long to wait. Dap stays flexible while Aqua Glaze hardens up. Agua Glaze is better suited to wood sash windows than metal. They recommend priming metal before you apply it to a metal sash. I used it on wood.. I was happy with the results (so far). I painted the frame about an hour later. Cleanup of the putty knife is a breeze since its water based.<br />I found this product because I was looking for a product similar to Elmers Glaze Tuff which I had used many years ago. I REALLY liked it. This is quite similar. I will need to see how it holds up over time. The &#34;Elmers&#34; held up pretty well.<br />The real problem with Glaze Tuff is THE COST!. This leads up to the deceptive photo.<br />The cost for a HALF PINT of Aqua Glaze is $7.49. The cost for the same amount of Dap is under $4.00 in a regular hardware store. When you add the cost of shipping, Glaze Tuff is over $13.00. This is FAR too expensive to make it practical. I glazed two 24x24 windows (one double hung) and did a touch up on a few others.  There is not enough product left to do any more than a few more touch ups. So a half pint doesn't go very far.<br />Now for the photo:<br />FIRST I am embarrassed to say that I really didn't read as well as I should have. There are only a few places to buy this product. It seems that the company called &#34;Life and Home&#34; is the distributor on a few sites. They use the same photo as well. The photo is a picture of a METAL can of Aqua Glaze and is labeled ONE QT. Of course I have already established that this is NOT One Quart, its a HALF PINT.  BIG DIFFERENCE! The photo doesn't match the description.  They don't sell a quart size HERE on Amazon. A quart size elsewhere, costs about $13.00 + shipping. You can order any available size from the Life & Home web site and the shipping may be less depending on location.<br />In any event, the metal can no longer exists anyway, regardless of the half pint or quart size. The picture is obsolete. The product you will get comes in a plastic tub with a tight fitting snap on lid. It will be marked STERLING Aqua Glaze. Sterling is a division of Savogran.<br />I actually verified all of this by calling the toll free number on the tub. Most of us are pretty much limited to buying this product from Amazon or Life and Home or another popular auction site.<br />Again, it is too expensive to be practical, but if you really want it, you are better off buying a QUART directly from Life and Home. Most of us can't use a gallon of the product, which is also available. The stuff would probably harden before we would ever use that much.<br />Professional painters, however, may have another option. Savogran said that the product can be ordered through Sherwin Williams stores. HOWEVER, you MUST order it by the CASE. Again only professional painters and contractors would need that much product.<br />Its really too bad that hardware chains like Ace or True Value dont offer this as an alternative to Dap.<br /><br />P.S.I will try to modify my review is and when the picture problem is fixed. Until then, be aware of what you are ordering and what you will get for your money.\n",

            "Review: Green tea is an acquired taste and, if you are new to it, the worst possible experience is to start 'safe', by trying out some of our established, mass-market brands of cheap teas that I shall not name here but we all know who they are. So don't do that and try the real thing instead. And this tin - purchased at a significant discount as a 'for review item' - is as close to the real thing when it comes to green tea as they get.<br /><br />It's not 'green tea at its best' because... check the price. But it's a very good, way above average and in fact, better that I would have expected at this price level. What you get it's real tea leaves, not the amorphous crushed powder that our cheap brands would offer and it produces a beautiful to see if you pour it in a glass, delicately flavored and exquisitely perfumed liquid that should be best enjoyed while hot but it's still very much drinkable if you take your time and it's much cooler by the time you get to your last sip. Like I said, drink tea is an acquired taste so, be patient, try it for a second time if the first glass  or cup did not impress you and, again, use the real thing. And this one is real. Or, for the same price, you can get some 1000 over-processed, crushed, artificially reflavored, pasteurized, anesthetized, nationally- branded, overall undrinkable bags that claim to deliver their version of 'tea' to you (I disagree).\n",

            "Review: In my opinion all the flavors of Soda Shaq are awesome. I had my doubts about blueberry cream soda before I tried this but thankfully it was way better then expected.<br />The reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 5 is the simple fact that the pricing for 24 is outrageous. Out where I live, Northern California a signal can of this stuff costs 0.99 plus tax depending on who you buy it from. This means a 24 pack should be less then 30 definitely not the 42 dollars being asked for here. If you are unlucky enough to live were none is being sold locally I'd say snoop around the net a bit more to see if you can find it for cheaper and if not then I'd say spring the 42 dollars and get. However given that its a 24 pack I'd only advise people who like blueberries and like cream soda to invest in this as you will more then likely love it.<br /><br />My advice is just check your local supermarkets and convenient stores for Soda Shaq first before you invest in ordering this for delivery because if you can get it locally you most likely get it at a far better rate.<br /><br />I'll close with this. The drink alone I'd give a solid 4 stars though I'm sure people who like blueberries would give it 5 stars.\n",

Creamy, crunchy or with chocolate!<br /><br />Handy snacks to pack in a lunch, eat on the go with no mess!  Happy healthy dose of protein for the whole family.<br /><br />  Grab a few boxes mix it up for lunches.  A smooth and creamy bar to slide into Mondays.  A little crunchy blend to get you over hump day.  Lastly how about a chocolate blend to celebrate Friday!  So portable for everywhere you may need a pick me up.  No real reason necessary other than to eat them because they are good!<br /><br />I’m a member of the Crowdtap Jif program, and Jif sent me a sample of its Jif Bars to try and asked me to review.  Mission complete great bars, the flavor is well balanced and the bar satisfys just enough hunger to keep me going.\n",

I had been craving Caramel Apples Cheesecake, so I also made some Cinnamon Caramel Apple Desert Topping to go on the cheesecake.  Later on, I created a Vanilla Bean and Sea Salt Body Scrub based on a recipe I found on the Sunny Day Organics website.<br /><br />The flavor Organically Grown Vanilla Bean Powder was just as fabulous as the smell.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the dark color.  This isn’t a problem for those recipes with a dark outcome, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a recipe you want to come out bright white like an Angel Food Cake.<br /><br />The only other recommendation I have about the Organically Grown Vanilla Bean Powder is to use half as much as you would normally use vanilla extract.  This wasn’t on the package, I had to research it on my own.  So, your personal preference may vary.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review.

            "Review: I decided on the West Lake Dragon Well green tea - what a unique taste!<br />I have tried many green teas from various places around the world, but this one definitely stands out.<br />I don't know yet if it will be my #1 green tea, but I do love this taste.<br />It is very aromatic, light and easy on the taste. It is not a strong flavor, or bitter like how black tea can be.<br />The leaves are dried, so they are extra crunchy and brittle. If you do not want too many bits floating around your tea, handle them with care so they don't break apart.<br /><br />I really don't know if $40 is a good deal - I know it is imported from China. I have been to China and to places where they plant, harvest, and manufacture them all in one place - Suzhou is one lovely city in particular - and I know the hard work and process it takes. It is easy to just buy tea at a cheap price and not really think about it. But to be fair to the other teas I have bought, I think up to $30 would be a more fair price. I also buy imported green tea from Japan, and they only cost $20 for 100 packets which lasts me months.<br /><br />Each batch that I use(about 64 ounces, or half an iced tea pitcher), I can steep three times from and still get a solid flavor, so remember: DO NOT replace them after one usage!<br /><br />*A sample was provided for the purpose of my objective review.*<br /><br />**I have worked very hard to achieve the ranking I have now. I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews. Therefore, I will ALWAYS state if I received the item complimentary from the vendor. Thank you, everyone, and have an awesome rest of your 2015!**\n",

            "Review: We like this product.  My child has been using this formula since 12 weeks old to supplement his breastfeeding.  I did extensive research (we were initially against any type of formula, but due to my milk containing very little fat, we had to supplement) and concluded that this was the best formula offered in the USA.  We feel confident that the manufacturer\u001a has remedied the arsenic issue and will continue to feed our son this formula as long as he requires it.  It is worth noting that if we could afford the Holle brand from Germany, we would have started our son on that product instead.  Update:  I just read this description for the product on Amazon and noticed that it said &#34;no measuring spoon was provided in order to avoid toxic exposure due to plastic.&#34;  Well, all six cans that I've purchased had contained a measuring scoop.  In fact, the cans that expire October 2016 have a new measuring scoop which is rounded on the bottom; which is a real pain as we portion our scoops on the kitchen scale.   FYI: make sure you're measuring these scoops out to exactly 8.5g or your child WILL become constipated. We weighed some scoops that came directly from the can and can get as much as 10+ grams with each scoop!  If you're making a 6oz bottle, that's an extra 4.5g!!!  That is way too much extra in every bottle. As most of us know, this product does have a higher​ casein protein content than breast milk, therefore it can be constipating at first, but with all that extra powder; no wonder!!\n",

Especially the Toffeecrisp which is my favorite. My husband is allergic to peanuts and I'm allergic to cashews which isn't usually a big deal we just stay away from nuts and none of these chocolate bars have nuts in them. But just in case we checked because sometimes they will add nuts without putting it on the package.<br /><br />However since I had been eating Toffeecrisps for years I opened that one up and took a bite out of it while my husband read the label checking for peanuts. All of a sudden I hear a s*!@ come from him and he's sticking his hand in front of my face but I had already swallowed.<br /><br />They had mango kernal in it?! Who the heck puts mango kernal in a candy bar?! Not to mention the pit of a mango can be VERY allergenic. We rushed to get benadryl and a glass of milk (calcium can help allergens go away faster.)  My throat and face got very itchy, and I got a sore throat but it wasn't bad enough that I had to go to the hospital, thank goodness!<br /><br />These are good chocolate bars that contain mango kernal but no nuts.

But if you developed a taste for Wolf Brand Chili (like I did in the 1980's & 1990's living in Dallas/Fort Worth) then this is the ticket.  It still tastes the same - a little greasy but YUM!!!  Much better than any other canned chili out there.  My only issue is that it is very hard to find here on the west coast.\n",

I loaded up my whole bean hopper/grinder, and brewed a pot using the same water/grind ratio as I always do.  Not sure what the proper description would be - weak?  bland?  Certainly nowhere in the same neighborhood as what I've come to expect from a good dark roast.  Oh well - guess I'll share with the folks at work and look elsewhere for my daily cup.\n",

            "Review: You decide on the flavor and types of teas you like. I cannot guide you with that. I prefer Black tea the most, followed by White, then Green. I find Green is just the most bitter, and Black tea goes down the smoothest. I also drink coffee every morning so the caffeine doesn't bother me. Black tea contains the most caffeine so I like that too.<br />I love this tea brand. I originally discovered it about 3 years ago also on Amazon.com. I buy fair trade and organic coffee, but I always just purchased store brand teas. And I said to my self, 'well why can't i find a fair trade and/or organic tea as well'?<br />So the search was started. It ended at Amazon.com (also where it began) and with this brand of tea. I had never heard of it before. After doing research this was the brand for me. The tea is manufactured with renewable energy and the teas are fair trade and organic which makes a better tea. Also, the tea bags do not contain any staples. I never noticed any metal flavor from any tea bag that had a staple, but their design is nice and more practical. They tie the string in a unique way to close off the tea bag which I am just fascinated by. I have never seen anything like it. The bags are not brown and unbleached, but they are not bleached bright white like most main stream manufacturers.<br />I like this White Peony tea because it is just a simple pure white tea. Which is exactly what I wanted. It didn't contain other leafs, spices, or flavors; it was just a pure tea. If you want a pure white leaf tea i would highly recommend this product.\n",

Though you can eat the wraps by themselves, I very much recommend only trying a small piece that way and then filling them up with whatever you want. I am not a vegan, nor a vegetarian, so I filled one up with scrambled eggs and it was so delicious. I am going to try other variations, but you do have to be cautious because if you are not use to the whole &#34;raw&#34; food or health nut way of life, you might be expecting the excellent buttery taste of a tortilla only to find that it really does taste like apple, kale, and spinach dried flat up like a fruit roll up so you can fill it up with whatever you want.

However, I would not buy this here. Head to you local Big Lots store if you have one, they sell these for $1 each at our local one. Never pay the prices for energy drinks on Amazon. You can get them so much cheaper locally, and if you cant find them, they are not worth paying way more than retail just to try them.  This version is not worth the money paid here.

I am suprised that I find the need to add other strong flavors when cooking with this chilli paste.  Today I used this making a cabbage pork sausage dish.  I used an anchovy oil, strong Sir Kensington mustard, and tamarind concentrate.  So, I prefer this as a portion of a flavor profile rather than a condiment.  I still like it.  Next I plan to try a savory onion apple salad dish...using this paste and vinegar, either tahini or peanut butter, sesame oil, touch of anchovy,  and maybe a (sir Kensington) mayo, hmmm.\n",

The price is a bit ridiculous as I know exactly how to make dulce de leche that is as good as this or any other legit dulce de leche (and trust me, folks, it's not gonna cost you more than a couple of bucks...MAX). But if you're down for throwing money around, this is a good product to chuck your cash at. I'd buy again if I had the extra money to spend. It's worth the one-time splurge, that's for sure.\n",

            "Review: A few months ago I ordered jumbo whole cashews from Swiss Colony, as I have many times in the past and, as always, I was very pleased with the product. But then I got to wondering if I couldn't find something similar--but for a lot less money. So I turned to my good friend Amazon and started looking!<br /><br />I was also looking to buy in bulk knowing that nothing is big enough for my family and the price would be much less. Thanks to helpful reviews from others, I decided to give these We Got Nuts' Roasted Unsalted Cashews, 4 lbs, a try. I'm glad I did! I've reordered numerous times since then and I've been uniformly pleased with each shipment. The cashews are fresh, tasty, large--albeit not as large as those I've ordered from Swiss Colony, but I'm not complaining. Considering the difference in price, well, frankly, there's nothing to complain about. I'm perfectly happy with these cashews.<br /><br />My one, minor, complaint is that they're supposed to be WHOLE cashews, while in practice a lot of them are actually halves. Sure, I know that probably happens in transit and everything, but still, it would be nice if the majority were whole; I'm guessing that, on average, anywhere from 1/4 to 1/3 of each can consists of halves.<br /><br />I find that there's not enough salt for my taste, which is easily solved with a couple shakes from a salt shaker. Besides, I'd rather have something not salty enough than too salty, you know? It's much easier to add salt than it is to take it away! Also, I would want to train my kids to eat with less salty flavors so that they will not develop any kinds of health problems in the future. Therefore, I am very happy with my choice.<br /><br />For the price, I think the quality, size, taste, and quantity are great, and I definitely recommend this product.\n",

            "Review: If you like Matcha tea or would like to try it, this is a good one! It's organic and truly Japanese - the package even has opening instructions in Japanese language. Matcha comes in a fine powder, so you add a teaspoon to a cup and brew with hot water. Due to its fine grind, you must whisk or stir it vigorously after adding water - or add a little water to make a paste first. I used water at 195 deg right out of our hot water dispenser and it was perfect. The Matcha flavor is up front and it tastes wonderful with a little milk and/or sugar added too. The package says that it contains caffeine but it is not a strong dose, not quite the kick of coffee like most teas. I enjoyed the quality of this product and the freshness and flavor! It also stays fresh in its foil-lined package.  Matcha appreciated! Update: okay, spoke too soon. It's got quite a caffeine kick too! :)\n",

I'm not Able to get there as often as in the past, so I was excited to find them on Amazon.  Received them in two days and have served them to friends who ordered right away.  It is so refreshing. The only suggestion I have would be to change the packaging to something like a ziplock closure. After freezing it is really difficult to squeeze the wine slush from the small opening. It would be much easier and not as cold on the hands to just spoon the slush from the pouch and reveal. Amazing , refreshing drink!\n",

Stated they would be 3 - 3.5 inches each.  It is smaller Stated there would be generous amount of reserve tea. There was less than 1/4 cup. Stated there would be detailed instructions included.  There were none.  ************************** The above was written upon receiving the scoby and I originally gave it 2 stars.  I just found out how to edit my review and want to update my review.  Originally, I purchased a dehydrated scoby from a company and made two batches.  While the acid content did go down, no baby scoby formed and the original scoby sat at the bottom.  I then purchased the one from Poseymom.  I started a second batch using her scoby.  Within 10 days, the scoby rose to the top and a baby scoby began to form.  It is 3 weeks into the process and a thick baby is forming.  The scoby I received was small; however, the batch of kombucha I put it in is 1/2 gallon.  I am very pleased with the results.  Just changed my review from 2 to 5 stars even though I only received one scoby, it has 'taken off'!\n",

Overall I really like the pop itself.<br /><br />The packaging though...Limited edition? Really? Who cares. 99% of people are going to rip it open, drink the pop and recycle(hopefully) the packaging. The bottle is a nice bottle, but completely superfluous. I mean this is not a 30 year old bottle of some fine vintage liquor or something. It is pop, produced in the last few months. I am glad that with the coupon I was given this was free.<br /><br />So if you want to try this, make sure you get it at a screaming deal or in another packaging.

The spice is right at the perfect point (around 800,000-900,000 SHU) and the quality of the peppers are awesome. Most dried Bhut Jolokia products are either too crispy or raped of the seeds. These guys are still a little bit juicy and the texture/flavor are great. I received them in packaging exactly like what is advertised and came with 10-12 pods. I hope to upgrade to Trinidad Moruga Scorpions or Reapers soon :D. The first one of these peppers I ate had me hooked on super hots! Will order ghost peppers from here again if ever needed.

I am no longer sick all the time as I was for years before. I was plagued with stomach aches, nausea and migraines. We started using honey to cook with but not every recipe can use honey. After lots of research I chose Sucanat as a brown sugar replacement. I really do love this stuff. I have found it best to let the Sucanat sit in the liquid you are mixing it with first so it can dissolve (It takes a few minutes with occasional whisking) and you may have to add a tad bit more liquid to compensate; not much though. It makes some phenomenal pancakes when cooked in coconut oil. It has an &#34;Island&#34; taste to it. I have not had a bad batch of this sugar yet and I'm sure if I did, Wholesome Sweeteners would rectify it. I now order Organic Cane Sugar from Wholesome Sweeteners to replace refined white in my cooking as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to go a more natural route in cooking. It has a pleasant smell and natural molasses taste that I really had never experienced before with store bought brown sugar. The price on Amazon is unbeatable to what you pay for this stuff at the grocery store also.\n",

It was just alittle hard to get the salted side of the flavor down when I already was thirsty and could taste salt from my sweat. I never had thought of it that way until I tried it at mile 5 of a 10 mile run. It was one of the stronger flavors that I had tried.<br /> I chose this flavor because I thought it sounded thirst quenching.<br />Overall, my best review would be to choose the flavor against the activity. If you're very hot and thirsty, then choose a flavor that isn't too thick or strong. I found strawberry/banana to be tolerable when running. Chocolate is yummy, but coats my mouth, so I find I drink and spit alot. (sounds gross, but runners will understand). I would def take chocolate and esspresso/coffee for skiing!\n",

The problem is getting it to light and stay lit. I have one of those long-nosed Bic BBQ lighters. Lighting the top, as directed, will start some smoke, so I'd go away to let it develop. Coming back five minutes later, I'd find that it may or may not be still smoking. If it is, you are good to go. If it isn't, you try again. Sometimes I've played the flame over the cone for half a minute at a time, without success.<br /><br />When it does work, the smoke is great. All of the flavors are good<br /><br />My advice is to make very sure the cone has well and truly started started smoking before you start cooking. That may cut the smoke time down to 10 or 15 minutes, instead of the advertised 25, so plan ahead.\n",

I may someday try my hand at home-made ones again but in the meantime, these are very, very similar to the ones they offer at the restaurant for a fraction of the price.  They are not overly-seasoned and I prefer to apply my own fresh lemon juice so I like that they are not &#34;overly-lemony&#34; in the can.

Until this stuff came out i really wasn't fixing much pasta anymore, which i was bummed about. Given the nutritional facts for this stuff, it's a great alternative and goes great fixed however you used to fix your pasta. It's a new product, so yes it's more expensive, but if you want to see something on the shelves in the long term, lend it your support. Definitely recommend Banza to anyone that kicked pasta from their diet but looks longingly at it when it's on someone else's plate.

Regrettably, for me, the search continues, (sigh). I bought the different flavors, (my #1 choice being Hazelnut), because I know sometimes a 'favorite' flavor may not taste good, but another may be more palatable, and the benefits will win out over the taste buds; but this was not the case for me, (primary user), nor for the family members that tried it. To me the taste of the artificial sweetener was overwhelming, and it just didn't taste anything like the flavor it claimed to be. I am willing to accept that it is just a matter of personal tastes, and if you are an avid coffee drinker, which I am,looking for creamer that will reduce all the 'bad' stuff, it is worth at least a try, you may like it. It is just subjective. I cannot say it tasted spoiled, or that it smelled bad, or tasted like some chemical, it just failed for me at least, to come close to my expectations of Hazelnut, Mocha, or plain cream.\n",

However, I went to grab one of these and cut it open to discover the same nasty mold other customers have reported on. The expiration date says &#34;06 FEB 2016&#34;, so that's not the issue. I read in another review that customer service told them it was a &#34;issue with a small batch&#34; but I have to call BS on that after seeing multiple people with the same issue. I opened up the other bars I had left and every single one had mold that started from the ends of the bar. On the plus side, the site of the mold ruined any hunger I had.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend staying far away from this product.

I must admit I was very pleasantly pleased with this coffee!! In fact, I am enjoying a cup of it right now. I do use some sweetener and cream in my coffee, and I am aware that will make it taste a little different vs someone drinking it black. But I must say the aroma is inviting, it's not too strong or off-putting.<br />Then comes the first taste. It's not bitterly strong nor is it so weak that I can't taste coffee. I truly enjoyed this coffee. My only complaint is the packaging. I understand the reasoning behind sealing it individually, however this makes it more difficult for me to store. I also get a few grains of the coffee in my cup, as it seems to somehow come out when brewing in my Keurig, but other than that I do like the taste and recommend it to someone who enjoys different coffees!

            "Review: This tea is calming. It gives me a feeling of peace (about half an hour after drinking it). I had my first cup while going through a very difficult situation. I had no expectations and couldn't remember precisely what had led me to purchasing it. The relaxation lasts for a few hours, I think, and there is no letdown phase. Also, there are no side effects or anything. It's not like medication.<br /><br />I have also found that it makes me more alert when I need to be alert but doesn't prevent me sleeping when I have it close to bed (probably because I'm more relaxed). This is very strange, but I've tested it out many times. Once, I felt too tired to work out with my husband, but after I had a cup of tea and sat around for a bit, I felt better, and our workout went well. Then, we were both anxious before bed (a different day, I think), and this helped us feel calmer.<br /><br />I really like the taste of the tea. There is a subtle sweetness to it.<br /><br />The first time I made some for my husband before work on a morning after he'd slept terribly, I didn't tell him it had calmed me (because then he stubbornly insists it won't work for him). I emailed him at his office and asked how he was feeling, if he had liked the tea. He responded, &#34;I feel peaceful when I have no reason to&#34; (meaning everything was insane in the office).<br /><br />The packaging has been changed, and there are no longer instructions on the back. The company sends an email message with instructions, but if you are using super fast shipping (like I did) and receive the tea first, you might be a bit disconcerted. I figured out how to brew the tea, of course--a kind purchaser sent me the instructions, and they are also photographed at the top of the order page. However, I wrote the company because I wanted to send the tea to others as a gift. They said they changed their packaging to save money, meaning all their teas are now the same on the back, without instructions or information.<br /><br />(I later remembered what led me to purchasing the tea: I've been trying out adaptogens with great success. It's interesting figuring out which ones work for me and adjusting how I take them. This is the first one in a tea form I've tried.)r />(I later remembered what led me to purchasing the tea: I've been trying out adaptogens with great success.

I've tried all the gluten-free flavors and this one, the classic is my favorite, over the chocolate chip and the lemon-ginger, though the others are worth trying as well.  The price is more expensive here on amazon than they were at my local gourmet food shop where they were $3 or $4 a box, but to me, they're so good, I'm willing to pay the amazon price of $6.44 a box.

            "Review: I just called their 800-446-5500 number and asked about gluten-free soy sauce (I have celiac).  The answer is this: before 2015, they did brew with a very small amount of wheat (even for the gluten-free soy sauce).  So check your production date on your bottle.<br /><br />Bottles that were manufactured this year in 2015, are 100% soybeans, salt and alcohol.  HOWEVER ... there is cross contamination concerns.<br /><br />Since they also produce the traditional soy/wheat soy sauce (shoyu), every time after they use the production line to make shoyu, the entire line is washed, sanitized, and tested for gluten - making sure it's only 2ppm of gluten (still gluten!)  Then they switch the production line to making gluten-free soy sauce. Also if it doesn't say &#34;organic soybeans&#34; in the back, it's genetically modified soybeans.  Only the &#34;organic soybeans&#34; one is 100% organic soybeans.<br /><br />And no, they will NOT stop making the shoyu.  So even though this has a great taste, it has 2 strikes against it:  1) cross contamination with gluten, and 2) not GMO soybeans.  Still looking for the 100% gluten-free soy sauce.\n",

            "Review: [[VIDEOID:49285d92ae7b2f9447a58ba594c32]]This review is for the Jols Sugar Free Forest Berries Pastilles, 0.88 oz Packets in a Gift Box (Pack of 12).<br /><br />These unique candies taste great. I had never had a flavor like this before. They are from Australia. The flavor is forest berries. I believe this is a blend of darker berries such as blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries.<br /><br />The box comes with 12 smaller packages. Each package is perfect for your purse. It has a top flap that keeps the candy fresh inside and it won't spill in your purse. Inside are 0.88oz of little ju-ju bee type chewy harder candies. The candies last a long time and are great for the movies. The little box will take you the whole show to eat. They don't stick to your teeth or melt in your mouth.<br /><br />The berries are offset by a subtle mint flavor that carries on your pallet after you finish each candy. You cannot taste the sugar-free sugars they use. I think they are using fructose and sucralose. They also blend in natural flavorings from berries and juice.<br /><br />5/5 stars for taste, value and ingredients.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.\n",

The included free sample of three Grade B beans were no better. I am returning them all, but now I have to pay for the return (a new package, postal). Will try a different supplier. Just a word about this seller's attitude. Instead of apologizing for poor quality control, they wrote:    &#34; I'm sorry that you are not happy with your beans. The full aroma of the beans will not be apparent until you make extract or cook with them.&#34; Meaning, you can't tell good beans from bad until you cook them? Ridiculous.

            "Review: So I legit just got this product yesterday, and I was very excited to try it out. After trying it, I was compelled enough to write a review for it.<br /><br />The taste on it's own is vegetal and sandy, neither are to be unexpected. It's subtle, though, sort of earthy. I was expecting it to taste far more &#34;green,&#34; something like lawn clippings or gnawing on some hedge leaves, but it's not, really.<br /><br />But there's never going to be a point where I just slam this stuff in a glass of water and drink it, so even if you're not keen on &#34;subtle earthy&#34; flavors, I wouldn't worry about it if you're doing what most of us are doing: making smoothies and shakes.<br /><br />Now, for me, I tend to buy fruit in bulk, clean, chop, and freeze it into individual &#34;smoothie packs.&#34; I prefer this method because I tend to drink a smoothie in the morning before my eyes have fully opened, because I'm not enough of a morning person to cook myself breakfast. So, this morning, into my bullet blender went one tablespoon (yes, I know a serving is 3 tablespoons, but for a trial run, who would ever use THAT much?) of Hemp fiber/protein powder, a smoothie pack of banana, mango, strawberry, and a heaping handful of spinach. Dropped in 1.5 tablespoons of plain, unsweetened, boring-old yogurt (for more protein and some additional &#34;creamy&#34; texture), some filtered water, and a bit of stevia because these last few smoothie packs didn't seem so sweet and  Blended for about 10 seconds, opened it up and was greeted by...<br /><br />...something that looked like decaying organic matter. You ever leave a bag of spinach in your crisper drawer and forget about it? You know that green/brown slime it turns into? That's what this looks like.<br /><br />I smelled it, however, and it smelled tropical. Like my smoothie pack normally does.<br /><br />I sipped it. It was velvety. It was good. It didn't really blend all that well, but I didn't expect it to. It hung in suspension with the liquid, and went down easily. Kind of had a velvety mouth-feel that wasn't what I'd call &#34;normal&#34; but totally unoffensive.<br /><br />So all in all, it works well in smoothies, and I imagine if you're not opposed to it turning whatever you're blending it with some sort of deep greenish-brownish color, you could probably mix it into quite a bit of stuff. I don't think that it'd be good in anything that wouldn't be thicker - smoothies and shakes are probably this stuffs wheelhouse.<br /><br />All in all, it's not bad. I like it well enough and will probably buy it again.ith the liquid, and went down easily.

            "Review: I bought this looking for a longer lasting alternative to regular Kingsford charcoal briquettes. Barbecues at our house are usually an all-day affair with over 40 guests so I really wanted to reduce the time used to switch out or add charcoal to the grill. I've used this charcoal a few times so far and am loving it. It produces less ash than the regular Kingsford charcoals and lasts much longer. I use 4-8 pieces of this at a time and they last over 4 hours giving me a hot steady heat throughout. That means less work and time spent on charcoal upkeep and more time to chat with friends and getting food out! Also, I read somewhere that if you're done grilling but this charcoal isn't finished burning, you can run this charcoal under water to put it out and save it to use next time. I haven't tried this yet though, since I usually grill to the end.<br /><br />I see some of the reviews mentioning the difficulty in lighting them. Binchotan-type charcoal like this is usually denser than regular charcoal and thus, harder to light. You need to apply heat a bit more consistently to get them to light. This is the way I do it: I light some regular Kingsford briquettes with a chimney starter (http://www.amazon.com/Weber-7416-Rapidfire-Chimney-Starter/dp/B000WEOQV8) and when they're ready, I pour them into the grill and spread them out. Then I lay the Thaan charcoal pieces out evenly on top of the lit charcoal (sometimes stacking them which seems to be more efficient) and leave them there to light. Alternately, you can use a charcoal basket lighter (something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Camp-Chef-Charcoal-Lighter-CLB-9/dp/B000M9NJ1G/) to light it on your gas stove.<br />Last tip: it's cheaper to buy this here from Amazon (with Prime) than direct from Pok Pok.... not to mention the faster shipping time.\n",

            "Review: My wife and I had stopped eating pasta for the most part in our at home diet in an attempt to curb overall carb consumption. I missed pasta and I longed for its sweet and usually sauce covered embrace. I first came across Banza in the aisles at Sprouts and figured i'd give it a try. I'm now taking time out of my day to write a review to support this new product. It's a great substitute for pasta, especially for those looking to keep a higher protein diet and to reduce carbohydrate intake. It prepares the same and tastes great. Prepare it however you love your pasta, you won't be disappointed. Personally, I like to make mine as follows: - 1-2 grilled chicken breasts diced into bite sized pieces - toss into the cooked strained pasta, add small amount of olive oil - add italian salad dressing (i prefer Wishbone) - add parmesan cheese - (optional) add red pepper flakes and/or hot chile oil (i use mongolian fire oil) - stir to mix and serve up hot Trust me, it's delicious.\n",

            "Review: After the novelty of these wore off, I was disappointed and they left an after-taste that persisted for hours.  (I am curious whether the actual berries also leave an after-taste or whether the after-taste is due to the fact that these tablets are manufactured in a laboratory. Having never tried the berries, I can't answer that question).<br /><br />Anyway, as a perennial dieter, I was hoping that these might be just the ticket to add sweetness without calories and avoid the weird after-tastes of artificial sweeteners. However, one thing that I fundamentally did not understand is that these only sweeten if the food you are eating is acidic or sour. Thus, I stupidly thought that if I popped one of these before eating pancakes, my pancakes would taste cake-like and therefore my desire to add syrup to top the pancakes would be gone. However, that did not prove to be the case because pancakes are neither sour nor acidic so the flavor of the pancakes was not significantly modified. Moreover, these ruined my morning ritual of drinking expensive Japanese green tea. I like my tea bitter and unsweetened and I was curious about whether these would have the unwanted effect of making my tea taste sweet, as if I had added sugar. That did not occur, but these totally blunted the flavor of the tea -- as if I was drinking cheap Lipton's tea rather than a super premium Japanese tea. In essence, the tablets destroyed the umami of the tea. I did not try these with wine, but I think a similar effect would occur -- i.e., these would blunt your taste buds so that a premium wine would taste like a cheap supermarket blend.<br /><br />Here are the other things I tried these with:<br /><br />Limes - tasted nice and made a lime seem like chomping on a dessert<br />Plain unsweetened goat milk yogurt -- added a subtle sweetness that made it easier to eat plain yogurt and somewhat camouflaged the &#34;goaty&#34; flavor of the yogurt.<br />Lemons -- wasn't as exciting as the limes - still tastedpretty sour. It was a different tablet than the one I used when I ate the lime - perhaps a manufacturing defect or perhaps the lemon I picked up wasn't as good quality as the lime?<br />Cherries -- had bought some cherries at the supermarket that were really disappointing because they weren't sweet enough and the tablets really improved the taste of the cherries, as if I had gotten super premium freshly picked cherries.<br />Blueberries -- same experience as the cherries. Really improved the taste of mediocre supermarket blueberries.<br />Granny Smith Apple -- didn't like this at all. Masked the sourness of the Granny Smith varietal, which I actually enjoy, and made it seem like I was chomping down on a mediocre supermarket Red Delicious.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I think these would be interesting if you wanted to have a &#34;tasting party&#34; with friends and experiment with how the tablets affect the taste of various foods, but as a tool for dieters, it is pretty much of a fail.  The biggest improvement was making mediocre supermarket cherries and blueberries taste better, but I would actually rather seek out less mediocre fruit (and, as stated, I actively disliked how these affected supermarket Granny Smith apples).<br /><br />As a dieter, for those few things where I miss sugar (like oatmeal or plain yogurt), I think I am better served by seeking out artificial sweeteners. To that end, I just ordered some &#34;Swerve&#34; from Amazon, one of the few artificial sweeteners I have not yet tried.[[ASIN:B004X71550 Swerve Sweetener, 16oz [1lb]]] At least that is less expensive and is not going to ruin my premium tea.\n",

            "Review: These Chia (also known as Salvia Hispanica) seeds from Sprouted Seed Co. are fresh and clean. They are not overly dried out and super tiny. These chia seeds are dark brown with some bits of white seeds- both colors offer same nutritional value. The chia seeds do not have a smell.  The Sprouted Seed Co. offers a quality chia seed that comes in a durable quality zip-lock type bag. I like chia seeds a lot for it's texture and for great nourishment. I do recommend buying the 2 pound bag of Sprouted Seed Co. Chia seeds with confidence for freshness and quality.<br /><br />I have found that mixing these Chia seeds with a cold tomato based liquid ( tomato juice, gazpacho, or virgin bloody Mary) and letting it sit for about 10 min in the fridge creates such a delicious refreshing and filling combination.<br /><br /> An even lighter and simpler taste is Chia with lemon water. I found a recipe online at nomeatathlete website called Chia Fresca or “Iskiate”<br /> -use about 10 oz of water<br /> -add 1 Tbsp dry chia seeds<br /> -add a few teaspoons fresh lemon or lime juice (or use True Lemon or True Lime)<br /> -if you wish  to sweeten add honey or agave nectar, or even a bit of sugar to taste (optional)<br />Stir the chia seeds into the water; let them sit for about five minutes.  Stir again, and let sit for as long as you like.  The more it sits, the more gel-like the seeds and water become.  Add citrus juice and sweetener to taste.<br /><br />It can’t get any tastier and simpler than that. :)<br /><br />***Also, please do drink lots of water on the days when you enjoy Chia seeds, it will help things stay regular because Chia absorbs lots of water- even during disgestion.<br /><br />I find that these Chia seeds drinks are very refreshing to drink on these sweltering hot days when the last thing I want to do is eat a meal. So for me, since a person should not just live on ice pops or ice cream alone during the hot days and be healthy, drinking a refreshing “meal” like gazpacho or a virgin bloody Mary (or just seasoned tomato juice) with chia is a great way to stay nourished during the hot mid-day until dinner.<br /><br />The Sprouted Seed Co., provided the Chia Seeds free of charge for me to sample. My opinion in this review is unbiased and based on my observation, use, and enjoyment of the product.

            "Review: Post-adulthood, most Americans claim to prefer their chocolate dark. However, their perception of “dark chocolate” as a confectionary is reflective of the brands they buy from candy stores and gas stations: slightly tart, but with some sweetness. Lindt is something else.<br /><br />Before you order this for your girlfriend, understand that this candy will not  sweeten her Valentine's day. In fact, she may look at you strangely—lips puckered, eyes squinty. “Is this even chocolate?” she may ask.<br /><br />Yes, it is. It really is.<br /><br />Bottom line, Lindt is for chocolate snobs who truly desire the fine taste of  cocoa—not the sugar and other sweeteners that big, kid-friendly corporations like Hershey and Nestle add to their products.<br /><br />For someone who is used to those, but still wishes to graduate to the real thing, I suggest starting with a bar that is 60-70 percent and working your up. To enjoy chocolate this pure, you must allow your palate to adjust. It took me a while to reach 90 percent. This candy is expensive for a reason; it's not meant to be eaten in bulk. Eat slowly—and savor.<br /><br />Initially, I was the boyfriend taken aback by a few nibbles of my rejected present. I felt fancy eating it, so I was determined to love it someday. Now, months later, I do.<br /><br />On the flip side: For 90 percent, this chocolate is actually pretty smooth—and there is, of course, an unhealthy reason for that. If you're scoping out dark chocolates for the health benefits you heard about on the radio, try another brand, something higher in antioxidants. Lindt is processed with alkali; it is also packed with carbs.\n",

            "Review: I've tried this from their 3oz multipacket bag for a $5 difference in price, but I love the flavor and ease of getting a quick glass of tea. It's a mix of green and black teas, powdered, and drank in total.  I work a swing shift, different turns each week. I like coffee, but got tired of the taste. I've tried their easy-to-use packets and enjoyed the flavor mixed with honey. So, seeing the savings $20-$25 for 3oz-10oz difference, I've tried and found it just as good. I probably use more as I don't have a measured scoop, but I feel it's a great value as long as you like it. I mix mine as a big glass of tea instead of the traditional slurry. So I have a bit of mud left in the glass, can drink it, but I dump it. Your preference, either way its a great substitute to soda, enjoy it.\n",

This Popcorners Kettle Popped Corn Chips combine all four wants into one light chip with great texture. The texture is kind of a bubbly, quilted texture which enhances the chips' appeal.<br /><br />The kettle flavor is just the right amount of sweetness to me so it's not overpowering, yet you can taste a bit of saltiness, too. And the chips are fairly healthy, as they are lowfat, low sugar and low salt.<br /><br />Ingredients listed on bag: enriched Yellow Corn {Yellow Corn, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid}, Sunflower Oil, Sugar, Sea Salt. The oil used is a healthy oil and like the use of sea salt instead of regular salt.<br /><br />These are air popped with real corn. One bag has 140 calories and is low sodium (110 mg or 5% DV) and low sugar (3g), so they are relatively guilt-free. There are no artificial additives or preservatives and they are gluten free. This kettle is one of my favorite flavors and the only sweet flavor they make.

            "Review: I mixed the pigeon peas half and half with jasmine rice along with a few cardamom pods and put it in my rice cooker. When it was finished I seasoned with some freshly ground peppercorns and Himalayan pink salt. (pictures attached). This is my first time trying pigeon peas (Arhar Dal) and I thought they were delicious and brought a lot of flavor to the rice. The Vedica Organics brand is certified organic and the only ingredient in this 2 lb. bag is &#34;organic pigeon pea.&#34; No genetically modified ingredients, no chemical additives...just peas!<br /><br />Rice and peas also make a complete protein so this is a great dish for vegetarians. They come in a resealable bag with a batch number and date of packaging. My date of packaging was 12/24/14. There was no expiration date on the bag which led me on an Internet quest to see how long dried packaged peas last. What I discovered is that dried peas don't lose any of their nutritional value with age - and that's why so many survivalists will stock up on these. Interesting. It's probably still better to keep them sealed in a cool dry place. I'm putting mine in the fridge.<br /><br />These are flavorful, healthy, and inexpensive. Would order again and highly recommend to others. I received this product to try at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.\n",

They are expensive especially with shipping, BUT they were packaged so well that not one pretzel was broken!  My rating is based on the taste however.  I did not care for the Extra Dark taste.  Have had this type before from other manufacturers and enjoyed them immensely.  Like how the extra dark adds depth to the taste, but these just tasted burnt to me.  Maybe the regular low sodium ones would be better, but as they were so expensive to begin with, I don't feel like taking a chance.  My rating is based on taste\n",

Since I live in a major metropolitan city with five different supermarket companies within easy reach I will never order this product again.  I purchased this on a whim to hit my $35 free shipping mark.  Silly me didn't notice I was paying three times as much what this normally cost from places like Wal-Mart. Stupid Internet impulse buying.  Needless to say I have since pulled my head out of my butt and will not make this mistake again.  I really don't know how they can straight face charge this much when you can go to the Wal-Mart website and purchase it for a third of the cost.  Ah well fool me once.  The product itself is fantastic.  I make the best malts in town with it.  I'd buy this any day of the week for entertaining guests or an after work pleasantry... just not from the Amazon vendor.\n",

            "Review: I became a fan of coconut water years ago – there are just so many reasons to love it!  Cocozia is 100% organic coconut water, and is one of those products that is a great staple for the pantry.<br /><br />If you haven’t tried plain coconut water before, it is really refreshing.  I have always been good about keeping hydrated, but in the summer, with two kids and a crazy schedule, it can be tough to eat and drink healthy.  I keep my Cocozia in the fridge and always have it ready to go for when I need to grab a drink on my way out of the house.<br /><br />I have heard people say they aren’t a fan of coconut water.  So if the taste of the coconut water alone isn’t for you, Cocozia has plenty of flavors to pick from, like pineapple and chocolate. Another option if you prefer not to drink it plain, is to add it into smoothies.  I use it in my morning green smoothies, and I know I am getting lots of great benefits.  Because it has a watery consistency, it makes a great base for smoothies, as it makes them easier to blend, but it has lots of great nutrients (as opposed to using just water).<br /><br />Coconut water is packed with lots of great benefits.  I first started drinking it when I was pregnant, because it has great nutrients and is hydrating.  It is also great for your digestive system, which can be a challenge while you are pregnant.<br /><br />The cartons are really convenient, especially in the summer, and I grab one every time we go somewhere.  I take a few when we go to the beach or the pool or even when I am working in the garden.  Overall a great product.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review on my blog.\n",

This is the BEST way to start my morning!<br />I am usually a medium / dark roast fan for coffee, as I like a little stronger of a  flavor to help get me going in the mornings, and this medium roast from The Purple Tractor is awesome! I drink my coffee black and hot, so it has to be good, because I don't camouflage the natural flavor with any additives, which means I'm a little more picky about what I will buy and drink, and this coffee totally passes my tests! I use it with the purple tractor's manual coffee grinder and reusable K cups for our single serve coffee maker and even my hubby has started drinking a cup with me because he likes the flavor as well!

I was a bit surprised by the amount of this I had to add to one cup of lemonade I had made, in order to get it as sweet as with regular sugar. I thought I might be able to use less than regular sugar. I don't have to add that much when I've used splenda.  After I drank it that morning, I ended up with bad diarrhea. Thinking maybe it was something I had eaten the night before, I tried some more xyla in a coffee drink the next day, this time using less in case I had used too much the day before (I saw the warning on the back about the side effects if used excessively). I added only one spoonful this time.  I didn't end up with diarrhea, but I did get an upset stomach and gas.<br /><br />I really like the taste of this product, but if it's going to make me feel like this, then I'll go back to using regular sugar and splenda!! I'm not sure if I should keep trying to use it and maybe my body will get used to it, but I have a big bag that is just going to go to waste if I can't stomach it :(\n",

It was liquid when I got it (I live in S Florida, so obviously it got hot in the mail on the way here) but it works the same whether it's a liquid or a solid. I use this as both a nutritional supplement and as a skin care product.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT: I take 2-3 teaspoons of this a day. It tastes like buttered toast! However when I took 4 teaspoons it gave me stomach cramps for an hour, so I recommend starting with 2 teaspoons and seeing how it sits in your stomach. Coconut oil is a really powerful anti-fungal agent, so if you've got a  problem like candida overgrowth, you can add this into your routine and it will help. You can also use it as a cooking product (like you'd use olive oil) but I haven't tried that.<br /><br />SKIN CARE: I use this right after I get out of the shower instead of lotion (I use lotion during other times of the day). A little bit goes a long way, and it takes a while to dry. BUT my skin is SO SOFT for like 24 hours after I use it. It also will help minimize scars if you use it regularly over a long period of time.<br /><br />I use this EVERY DAY and I've had it for nearly a month, and I'm not even halfway through the tub yet. So if price is a concern, just know that this will last you a LONG time if you're using it like I am. Definitely worth the money.\n",

            "Review: My family has read up on what organic raw Apple cider vinegar is good for. Regular apple cider vinegar takes your breath away. This doesn't! Mix 1 tablespoon with 1 tablespoon of raw natural honey in 16 oz of water then drink it. My daughter in law tryed regular vinegar and gaged her. I dreaded trying it but I'd ordered this one and mixed up a glass after it came today. Nice taste! It's good for burning fat, lowers colestral, blood pressure and high sugar. I'm sure there are other things it's good for. I will be drinking it each day. Amazon sells the honey (which I'd been using) in different sizes. The 3 pound bottle is soft so mixed well. I have the E.S. Pressed honey that is solid also but don't know how it would mix. I eat it by the spoonful. You can put the jar in warm water to liquidate it but I didn't want to. The solid honey is so tasty I could eat the whole jar. Someone had posted you can buy this at Walmart a lot cheaper. My husband is going to check Royal King.<br /><br />Update. After checking Walmart and GNC it is not the same as this vinegar. Read this label...Unfiltered, unheated and unpasteurized. The vinegar at walmarts ect? Do not say that on the label. I'll stay with Amazon.<br />Another update. My daughter in law found this exact vinegar at krogers today for $6.00. A 32 oz bottle.\n",

            "Review: The first time I made this tea, I brewed it hot- the scent and flavor was so strongly vegetal that it tasted like roasted corn and I just didn't have the stomach for it. I left it to sit on the counter for a few days, not sure what I would do with it, when I decided I should give it a try iced.<br /><br />WOW. What a difference! I first brewed the tea hot in a standard size french press, then drained the brew into another pitcher. I added a generous squirt of honey (perhaps 1.5 tbsp) and left it in the fridge to cool overnight. The result is absolutely fantastic. That sharp corn taste has been muted significantly by sweetness of the honey, leaving the tea tasting so much smoother with a slight grassy flavor. If you enjoy Honest Tea's Honey Green bottled tea, you will ADORE Majani Tea's Faraja tea iced with a dash of honey. Honestly, I can't even go back to buying Honest Tea after this. Great job Majani!\n",

White is my least favorite, but I'm not complaining.<br /><br />In my opinion, and talking about texture only, these wine gums are somewhere between Maynards wine gums (which spring back into shape after you squish them) and Dots (which stayed squished).

            "Review: I had never heard of broad beans and I was a little nervous to try them. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are delicious. My husband started snacking on the garlic and onion flavor bag and I tried one. I stole the bag from him and finished them off. I am eating the sea salt flavor beans now as I type this and they are my favorite flavor. They have a nice crunch to them, they have a slight sunflower oil and kind of nutty taste, and enough salt to give a good flavor without going overboard at all. My husband very much enjoyed the wasabi and sriracha flavors. He appreciated that these came in such unique flavors. He said both of them had a perfect flavor level and he was very interested in ordering more. I love that a 1 oz serving is 100 calories, low in fat, and provides a decent amount of fiber and protein. They are very well balanced as far as nutrition is concerned. Also, the ingredients are very straight forward. For instance, the sea salt flavor lists: broad beans, sunflower oil, and sea salt. That's it! No added junk. I'm also very pleased with the fact they are non-GMO verified. I try to eat as healthy and natural as possible and avoiding GMOs is on the top of my list of important things with food. We received a variety pack with four 1 oz snack bags (wasabi, mesquite bbq, sriracha, and garlic & onion) and one 3.5 oz resealable bag of the sea salt flavor. All of them were crunchy and delicious. We will definitely be ordering more since they taste great and fit in so well with my low calorie and low carb snack criteria. I am even comfortable giving them to my 6 year old and 2 year old. They both keep coming in while I'm typing this to ask for more. :-)  I received the Enlightened Crisp packages at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All of my thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.\n",

            "Review: I've tried a number of differed herbal teas over the past 2 years and Dandelion tea certainly has a very interesting taste!.<br /><br />If you are buying this purely for taste then I would not recommend it as it tastes very strong and earthy. Not pleasant in any way I'm afraid but what it does offer is a number of different health benefits that other herbal teas can't offer.<br /><br />It contains a healthy amount of potassium and the effect that this has on your body is that it 'pushes' sodium out from the body, reducing water weight. Obviously it would be unrealistic to expect your water weight to completely disappear after drinking a handful of cups but it will support weight loss very well and I can verify that it is effective at doing that.<br /><br />Dandelion also assists digestion, liver detoxification and a lot, lot more so it really is worth putting up with its strong earthy taste to experience all those health benefits. If you want to experience it's health benefits but can't drink it you can just wait for it to cool a bit, hold your nose and then swallow!.<br /><br />In most cases I always have 2 tea bags in a cup everyday and once a week I have a super condensed amount of it - 4 tea bags in a giant mug!.\n",

She has the trophies & the ribbons to show just how authentic she is. Not to mention that she has been a guest on the Martha Stewart Show for her placek (coffee cake).<br /><br />I'd never heard of baking ammonia before and had no idea what it was. Karen uses it in her Anise Pierniki (Polish cut out cookies) to make them crisp. With the ammonia, they literally snap when you bite into them. Amazing!<br /><br />Like so many other &#34;homemaking&#34; arts, this way of cooking and baking is disappearing. We could no longer find this product anywhere locally. Fortunately, there's Amazon! Thanks to this seller and this product, Karen's pierniki has its trademark snap!\n",

One issue with chocolate is finding bars not alkali processed to preserve the anti-oxidant qualities (fully understand many people may not like the bitterness and prefer &#34;Dutch&#34; processed chocolate).  It isn't obvious Chocolove is dutched.  Don't know.  However, it is tasty chocolate.  My favorite is Valrhona 85.  If Valrhona doesn't hit it for you, adjust my rating.<br /><br />This bar is relatively complex in flavors  - not up to Valrhona but close - and should satisfy people who like dark chocolate.  I noted many reviews were by tasters who obviously should be aiming at lower cocoa content and were attracted by health benefits.  Eat what you like.  The other comment to add is the best beans are from remote locations.  Doesn't matter the source of the bar ... Belgium, Swiss, France (Valrhona) or in this case Boulder, CO.\n",

I've tried it both ways, but I usually add it raw to Greek yogurt, and it adds a little crunch and a little variety.<br /><br />I like this, but I think it is a bit too expensive for what you are getting. There are 5 1/2 cup servings. I usually add about a 1/4 cup to yogurt, but when I added it to boiling water I used a cup, and that was about right for breakfast.

Erythoritol, organic stevia extract, potassium citrate, citric acid, ascorbic acid, organic coffee fruit, white tea extract,......

Yes,  that means for the first few days you may  need to be close to the bathroom people.  I've been drinking 3-4 of these a day and eating grilled chicken Cesar salads every day now for 3 weeks and not only have I LOST 9 pounds of fat weight that I had tried every diet under the sun to lose BUT my energy is 3x as high as it was before,  I'm having a much easier time breathing and my stamina has doubled.  after 9 months of not being able to work out because of shoulder surgery I ran 6 miles for the first time since January and I wasn't winded and could've kept going.

I read various reviews before talkng the plunge, i did as instructed and left the pint out for 10-15minutes before taking my first scoop. Well...not bad. Honestly a very very light consistancy, more icy than creamy. I honestly couldnt fathom eating more than a serving. It has a mild mouth feel of &#34;ice cream&#34;, but u clearly know thats not what you're eating. I think it could be a good replacement when ur having a strong desire for ice cream, without the guilt of all the added sugars and calories.

            "Review: The coffee itself is really good.  Flavor wise its a decent dark roast but amazing for being robusta.  It does have a good caffeine kick even in k-cup form and even on a second brew (flavor is weak but caffeine still there).  The reason for the four stars is due to price and the fact that this coffee doesn't translate into k-cups well.  You get the usual k-cup blunting of flavor and to make things worse these k-cups are not sealed and the coffee starts to degrade rapidly even in my airtight sealer.  I am all for biodegradable k-cups for the environment for everyday 80 pack coffee but not for special occasion buck fifty a k-cup coffee.  I recommend buying the coffee in ground or even better bean form and then using a French press or at least a k-cup reusable filter for this stuff.  For the ultimate kick though Google black blood of the earth coffee.  Some scientist type cold filters Death Wish coffee in a vacuum and makes an coffee that is acid free and 80 times stronger caffeine wise than regular coffee.  It is expensive but oh so yummy and addictive and you drop half a shot of that in any k-cup coffee and you have a stronger kick than even these k-cups.\n",

The tea itself is caffeine-free, of course, and has a flowery chamomile and citrus-y flavor.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry.

Plus, it's individually wrapped, so it's easy to take along. However, the last time I ordered it, the third piece I ate was stale & I didn't want to take a chance that there would be other stale pieces. I called Amazon, who contacted the seller, and THE VERY NEXT DAY I had a replacement. I am impressed with the seller, by the way. But the replacement bag is the same; I did have one stale piece so far. I haven't finished the bag yet, but I have to say, lately, it's not a consistent product. I'm disappointed, because as I mentioned, I really, really liked this product.\n",

The blackberry and blueberry taste are apparent in its flavor without having that after bite of bitterness that blackberries and blueberries can have. I have even frozen this juice in ice cube trays and popped the ice cubes in tall glasses and poured cold, unsweetened iced tea over them. Add a sprig of mint and no sugar is needed in your tea.  I also like to pour two cups of this juice in a blender. Add fresh fruit like peaches, pineapples, strawberries, a zing of lemon juice, a handful or two of ice cubes and whir around until it makes a slushy drink.<br /><br />I actually ordered this on a whim.

Instead, I found a few other brands and chose the Santa Fe beans primarily because they have the lowest price per ounce. I tried this variety pack and was really impressed - I feel like the quality and flavor are actually better than any other dehydrated bean I've tried. I just ate them for dinner with some warm tortillas and they were so delicious that I forgot all about the salsa I had sitting on the side. I always like to season my food and to these I added a dash of freshly ground Himalayan pink salt and peppercorns.<br /><br />I do want to comment on the cooking directions. It says, &#34;Bring 2-1/4 cups of water to a boil on stovetop or in microwave. Stir in contents of package. Cover and allow to simmer on low heat for 5 minutes. Stir occasionally, add seasoning to taste. Decrease or increase water to your desired consistency.&#34; It may sound picky but cooking in the microwave vs. stovetop are two different things. If you're cooking in the microwave, don't worry about boiling water first. Just dump the whole package in a big bowl and add about 2-1/2 cups of water and seasoning. Stir it up real good and microwave it in 1-minute increments, up to 5-6 minutes. After each minute, take it out and stir, and stop microwaving when it's about the thickness desired. Then let it sit for 1 minute.\n",

Feel a burst of energy! No creamer needed! It's healthy for you!  Why wouldn't I want all of those things? After ordering online and eagerly waiting to try it, it finally came in. I was happy it was so simple to make, though I'm not much of an instant coffee fan. Aside from how easy it was to make, I found nothing else good about this product. Personally, I don't see how it is healthy and makes you lose weight when it contains SO MUCH sugar! 1 serving size calls for &#34;2 heaping tablespoons(30g)&#34; mixed with hot water. In that 30g is 19g of sugar. Over half! I'm sorry but I do not feel healthy drinking this while knowing that. Even with all of that sugar and not drinking coffee for two months, i felt ZERO energy after drinking 3 regular sized coffee cups of it. If I could give this product half of a star instead of 1 star, I totally would.

            "Review: These are the best stuffed olives I've ever had the honor to enjoy. They are especially tasty as a Gin Martini finisher. The olives are crisp (not the usually soggy type). The garlic and jalapeno are crisp and crunchy. Fantastic. The lucky gourmand will not experience a vinegary taste to the olive brine. It is just a nice, mellow preservative and taste enhancer. You will only experience a mild hotness from the jalapeno.<br /><br />Do not be afraid of this large jar. I've had a jar in the refrigerator for months and experienced nary a bit of microbial degradation. BJ's carries this for 6.99$ at this time.\n",

            "Review: I've always been a bit of a salt fanatic and after being introduced to Himalayan Pink Seat Salt several months ago I've made a point to search out different cuts and flavor infused sea salts and when I came across this pack of 3 different gourmet salts I was excited to try them.  This set comes in 3 glass bottles that are actually nice enough for gift giving and the squared bottles fit perfectly in my spice rack.  The black and the white flaked sea salt taste similar, pretty much how you expect salt to taste and both dissolve easily.  The citrus lemon sea salt is my favorite, I've used it in my shrimp scampi as well as other fish dishes and I used it to make a citrus chicken that was to die for.  While I love the set as a whole I really wish they had been accompanied by more appropriated shaker tops, it's always a pain to have to take off the shaker lid to get the amount of salt you need without spending an ungodly amount of time shaking, and shaking, and shaking but this could easily be resolved by simply using one of my own spice bottles.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product\n",

            "Review: We’ve been Nespresso users for more than 20 years, first in Europe, than in Canada, and more recently in the USA. We love the coffee and are enjoying it several times a day. This being said, we feel like Nespresso is taking advantage and are raising their prices constantly. They’re now selling their pods for $0.72 or more. Just down the road, we have an Italian coffee shop who charge me $1.00… No comment here.<br /><br />Looking online I found Hiline Coffee as an alternative and decided to place an order that I just received. So... Not only their prices are absolutely reasonable, but the coffee is excellent. The pods fit perfectly into the De Longhi Nespresso machine, you have a great variety of taste, the order are shipped quickly, they're very well packed, and a great customer service that's ready to answer all your questions.<br /><br />I can only recommend them to anyone who's using Nespresso and think that the prices are now a little... Overboard.<br /><br />Thanks HiLine for coming up with an alternative! Keep it up!\n",

            "Review: This looked like an interesting change in the chips department, so I ordered it to check out the flavor. I find them to be very tasty, a bit thin for holding dip, and to have a good ingredient list.<br /><br />The chips are about 2 inches around - if you can find an unbroken one (see below). They taste mildly of beans, but it is not overpowering, and the flavor is well balanced. I like the flavor, and it is a bit addictive - I ended up eating much of the bag at the first sitting! They are superior to corn chips to my taste buds.<br /><br />I see from the product page that others have posted the ingredient list and calories, so I won't repeat that here. Suffice it to say that the ingredients include corn as the second item, but in my opinion that is a still better product than conventional corn chips. The rather high fat calories means they will provide long term fuel in addition to the carbohydrates for short term.<br /><br />The only thing I found wrong with them is that they are a bit thin, which means they break easily. This has two consequences. First, most of the chips arrived broken (but still tasty). Second, you will need to be careful when using these for dips - they are not nearly as strong as conventional corn chips.<br /><br />Cost wise, consider if you really want them; they are expensive compared to the regular chips.<br /><br />Summary: Tasty, a bit expensive, but somewhat healthier than pure corn chips. Recommended if you can afford them.\n",

However, when the package arrived, the k-cups were in a gray plastic bag, not in a box.<br /><br />I didn't sent them back because it was too late. And let's face it, the coffee tastes the same and my husband didn't care about the packaging. I just wanted to warn anyone who may be purchasing this to give as a gift-- I was disappointed that I gave him this ugly bag rather than the nice-looking box.

            "Review: Back in early April of 2015, during a visit to my Endocrinologist, I mentioned to my doctor that I eliminated most carbs from my diet.  I still eat bread, but I use Nature's Own Whole Wheat loaf.  I also eliminated rice and traditional pasta from my diet and began to eat more vegetables to help control my diabetes.  She asked me if I used sugar and I told her I only use Splenda sweetener in my coffee.  She recommended I switch out Splenda with a natural Stevia product.  Ideally she recommended a liquid Stevia, but figuring out the cost and I am a heavy coffee drinker, the liquid stevia would cost much more than Splenda.  Later that evening I browsed through Amazon to see what they had to offer me and I came across this product.  At first, I thought it was extremely pricey for a pound of this powdered Stevia, but the description stated I believe a 300:1 sweetness ratio.  When I finally received it in the mail, I certainly believed the 300:1 because a half teaspoon of this in my coffee made it unbearably sweet.  I had to toss out that cup of coffee and try again.  I was so surprised at how miniscule of an amount was needed to make a cup of coffee sweet that I filled up a clean unused salt shaker with this product and just two gentle taps from the salt shaker made my coffee perfectly sweetened.  Well that was April.<br /><br />Today as I write this, it’s July 30 2015 and I still have more than 2/3 of the bag left.  WOW.  I have used this product for both Coffee and Quinoa and Almond Pancakes, Hot and Cold Teas and many other things around the house and I am so impressed at how little I have to use.  I paid forty-six dollars at the time for the 500g bag, and in that time I used 1/3 of the bag over a period of 3 1/2 months bring my total cost to fifteen dollars of use.  BJs Club store brand of Splenda  would have cost me 45 dollars by now to cover those same months.  Nevertheless, this product is natural and better for me.  Today I had my A1C tested and it is 5.8 down from 6.5, and down from 8.7 one year ago.  Healthier eating and using this product has improved my diabetes so much that I highly recommend it to any other diabetics.  Yes, there is a aftertaste when used in hot liquids like hot tea or coffee, but I found myself getting used to it after a while.  I rather deal with a small aftertaste than eliminating many of my favorite foods.  This product is truly the best sweetener I have ever used and it has earn a permanent spot on my wish list to reorder.  However, I still have 2/3 of a bag left :) :) :)  Just use a salt or peppershaker as your Stevia dispenser instead of opening the big bag every time you need to sweeten a beverage.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/27/2016 ***********<br />I finally filled my copper salt shaker (stevia dispenser today)  with what I had been left from the first original 500g bag of stevia.  My first order was placed on April 14, 2015 and I expect to use up the last of it probably by the end of the first week of June 2016.  I estimate the bag will have lasted me for 13 1/2 months.  My recent doctor visit still has my A1C at 5.9.  As I said before, this sugar substitute is the most cost effective sweetener I have ever used.  I originally paid forty-six dollars for the 500g bag, divided now by 13.5 months.  My monthly cost came out to USD 3.41 dollars per month or 0.88 cents per week.  Not bad eh?<br /><br />I have another helpful suggestion for people on the move.  Use a small travel sized salt shaker with cap and fill it with this concentrated stevia.  Small salt shakers can be found here on Amazon or cheaper at your local dollar store. Order your favorite beverage without sugar/unsweetened when dining out.  I often ask for an unsweetened ice tea at restaurants and diners.

I can drink a glass and not feel like I need more which is a good thing or I would have gone through this entire container by now :D  The flavor is very very good and something to have on-hand for when you receive unexpected visitors or you've ran out of other things to drink.  That's why I purchased it.  You can also use this as mixer for drinks if you don't have anything readily available.  Good price and Good Taste. 5 stars.\n",

I discovered that all the other brands were super sweet which overpowered the guava flavor but not this brand. They no longer carry this at my local store and La Constancia has also changed the label according to the photo. If they haven't changed the recipe, I would order it again - unfortunately, 6 bottles is 5 bottles too many.  Please carry 1 or 2 bottle quantities. Thanks :)\n",

            "Review: I usually put soy protein powder in smoothies, but I was intrigued by the idea of using a different plant protein and have fiber included, so I tried Hemp Pro Fiber and ordered it through Prime Now.  This doesn't mix well with anything that I've tried and it mostly winds up at the bottom of a glass if I don't drink it within a couple of minutes.  The bottom of the cup/glass winds up looking like a slushy soil and the flavor and texture is unpleasant.

But she also likes a bargain and, sad to say, this is NOT a bargain. Yes, the taste is great but it comes at a price. She has found a cheaper alternative that is almost as good at one of our local supermarkets: VICTOR ALLEN FRENCH ROAST (DARK ROAST) at $19.99 for 80 cups, which equals 24.9 cents a cup vs 33 cents a cup for the San Francisco Bay OneCup Fogchaser. That is almost 10 cents a cup cheaper! That's significant! However (and this is important), my wife says the taste of the San Francisco coffee is worth it! Really? I am NOT a coffee drinker so I have no input about this issue. I'm just the messenger/reviewer: I do what my wife tells me to do. It has made for 20 years of marital bliss! As I have told my son many times (and his wife says he must have listened), the key to marital bliss is as follows: do what your wife tells you to do, keep your mouth shut, and do not talk back! Also, say &#34;Yes, dear, you are right!&#34; often and with sincerity!\n",

I began a workout and diet routine at the time I started taking using this and have noticed no extra help with weight loss. Because of this, I am stopping the product.

            "Review: Anyone out there remember Metrecal?  It was a liquid meal sold as a diet aid.  Four cans a day @ 225 calories a can was supposed to be a full day's nutrition.  Metrecal was the first thing I thought of when I tasted Boost 100.  So I got curious and went to look up Metrecal which has been off the market since the mid-70s.  From what I can gather the ingredients are roughly the same, skim milk powder, soy protein, oil, vitamins and minerals.  Since both Boost and Metrecal have their roots in nutritional supplements for people who can't have a solid diet for whatever reason, it stands to reason that if it worked then, it's still going to work.  And in fact that combination delivers a solid 10 grams of protein in each bottle, plus vitamins, minerals, some carbs and fats.  It's a solid nutritional supplement with the added benefit of being low in calories<br /><br />Now if you look up Metrecal online you'll see all sorts of hand-waving about how awful it tasted.  While I think that's mostly hyperbole from people who probably never even tasted the stuff,  I'm not going to try to tell you it was the best thing since Cherry Garcia ice cream.  It wasn't and neither is Boost 100.  It's drinkable, nothing more.  It's not a treat, but it won't make you gag.  The advantage to Boost is the nutrition.  If, for whatever reason, your diet isn't giving you enough nutrition, then this may help  Personally I have a lot of trouble getting enough protein in my diet, so Boost is something that I may use on a regular basis.  Not enthusiastically, mind you, but because it's one of the better choices.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's probably as good as any other convenient nutritional supplement.  I think it's a bit pricey at a bit over $2 a bottle, but if you don't use more than one a day, it's not not a bad investment in your health.\n",

As i said they were not terrible but i would definetly not recommend them for almost 10 dollars plus 6 dollars shipping. I recieved this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. I wish i could rate them better but the product has a great concept but the taste is just not there for me. The product came shipped in a bubble envelope with 3 package of peanot cups that weighed 2oz the item description said that they were 1.6 so that is an advantage. The package also contained an ice pack to keep the choclate cold. The peanut filling had an artifical taste to me and the choclate was way overpowering.\n",

I have used many other brands before for the same uses, but for whatever reason this particular coconut oil has worked the best. I have always used coconut oil in my hair, but after just one use with this oil my hair felt baby soft. I used it all over my head, scalp included, and after washing it out with shampoo there was no oily residue, I didn't even feel like I needed to condition. In addition to my hair I use it on my face and all over mine and my baby's body- we both have eczema. On a final note, this oil actually SMELLS like delicious coconut, it's amazing.\n",

As a matter of fact, i love everything about ordering these, receiving them, the seller, the quality and the quantity!<br />They are exactly as pictured, each blend in it's own small glass jar (although small, they each pack a whollop, and will last a considerable amount of time, due to quality of the blend, airtightness of containers and amount in each) , they were shipped in a tube, surrounded by large bubble wrap, which was then surrounded in tissue paper, taped that way, and shipped in a bubble mailer. I ordered this on Saturday night, and received it Wednesday (SO FAST!) The truffle is strong in flavor, the porcini is strong in flavor, the Herb Blend has Juniper in it, (the fennel one did as well) which was a pleasant surprise for me, as i have never used it as a seasoning before. (SO FRAGRANT!) The Saffron Salt had a more than generous ratio of saffron threads to salt (considering the cost of saffron, I got MUCH more than i paid for )The Fiori Blend even has some larger identifiable flower pieces (a surprise to be sure, but I was also intrigued) as a gourmet food hobbyist (Someone who dabbles in creating gourmet food at home) I was insanely happy with this purchase!

I sautéed this up today with broccoli, bell pepper, and zucchini and dumped the sauce over all of them, and then poured it all over rice. I reheated some when I got to work and was thrilled that I liked the texture even after it had been microwaved! I enjoyed the sauce, although I used the whole sauce pack for half of the bag of chicken. (The sauce needed to get on the veggies and rice too!) I wish that since there's three servings of chicken per bag that the sauce was divided up into three packets. Otherwise, this was a success and I'll certainly be repurchasing this product again!\n",

I have heard that antibiotic treatment calms down H. pylori but will not completely eradicate it, which explains why I still felt as though I had it after antibiotic treatment.  Now, if I forget to take mastic gum for a while and start having stomach pain and indigestion, I start using mastic gum capsules again and soon feel much better.  I was hoping that these little pieces of mastic could be chewed to improve my breath, which seems to be a problem for many years since I first got H. pylori.  But, they are very hard, flavorless and dry and do not help my breath.  This is a lot like chewing wax.\n",

            "Review: I was able to try this product for free with BzzAgent, which was a great opportunity.  I have made my son's baby food since he started eating solids, so I was a little nervous to try Beech-Nut Organics baby food. However, the fact that it is organic and &#34;simple&#34; made me less nervous.  It is made with a few ingredients, mainly focusing on the fruit or vegetable and not adding all the preservatives.  Another reason I make my own baby food is to save money. When I was at the store, I purposely looked at Beech-Nut Organics and noticed that the price really wasn't that bad. Now on to the good stuff ... The &#34;just sweet potatoes&#34; has a really good consistency, making it easy for baby to swallow.  The color is a very pretty orange too ... not that baby would notice, but makes for a super cute messy baby face.  My son loved this food and was mad when it was gone. The orange mess on his face was cute and also didn't stain his face. You never know with bright colors if it'll stay behind after wiping, but not with Beech-Nut Organics. The smell of the food was also pleasant, also not an issue for baby but more for moms.  The container is made of glass which could be dangerous if dropped, but makes moms worry less about BPA and other things in plastic. The mouth of the jar is wide and makes pouring or putting a spoon in easy. Overall, I was pleased with this product and wouldn't mind giving it to my son in the future.\n",

I have been using Chia seeds on a regular basis for nearly 2 years. The uses for these seeds are limitless and it is a great vegan way to get vital Omega-3s, among other nutrients, into your diet.

            "Review: These are wonderful when you have a kid who eats like a bird, is picky and could benefit greatly from something with vitamins and minerals. If they happen to like chocolate milk, you're in luck. I know we are. My son loves these and getting him to eat enough all the time can be hit or miss.<br /><br />For years when he was younger it seemed like he hardly wanted to eat anything. Now that he's in his early teen years, he is starting to pick up an appetite. But it fluctuates constantly. One day he can pack away a half pound burger, a salad and fries like it was nothing. Then the next day he might leave 90% of his food on his plate and says he's not hungry. So for years I've pick him up drinks like V8 V-Fusion, which tastes like a fruit drink but also has veggies in it. Anything I can get him that he likes, so that if he's having on of his &#34;not hungry&#34; days, he's getting something with at least some vitamins in it.<br /><br />While he likes the V8 V-Fusion, he's not as much of a juice drinker as his sister is. He'd rather have milk. More specifically chocolate milk. These Carnation high protein drinks are perfect for him. He LOVES them. Lots of vitamins and even a dose of protein in them make them so much more than a plain chocolate milk drink. They're great for early mornings when he's not really hungry enough to want to eat anything yet, but still needs something to start the day. These are going to be his new school lunch bag drinks too. So much better for him than his other lunch drinks and the bottles have lids that can be put back on and taken off over and over. So if kids are drinking them and need to close the bottle and put them in their bags or backpacks, they won't spill. These are great!\n",

However, these taste fantastic, and most importantly to me, they are a great travel companion.  They do not take up a lot of space, and can handle high or low temps with no problems - an ideal snack that also gives you a bit of hydration at the same time.  I had two packs of these Trekking in the Amazon, and believe me, when it is 100 degrees, humid, and you've drained your two water bottles, stopping for a rest and breaking out one of these was like a little slice of heaven.<br /><br />Tip: watch for sales.\n",

            "Review: As an avid gum chewer it pains me to write this..however you should spit your trident gum out right now and throw whatever is left of the pack in the trash immediately...Its got several cancer causing and mystery ingredients that are obviously very bad for you or at least extremely suspect of being so...<br /><br />Aspartame: If your gum is sugar-free, there’s a good chance it contains the artificial sweetener aspartame. Aspartame is metabolized inside your body into both wood alcohol (a poison) and formaldehyde (which is a carcinogen used as embalming fluid and is not eliminated from your body through the normal waste filtering done by your liver and kidneys). It's been linked to birth defects, cancers, brain tumors and weight gain.<br /><br /> BHT (Butylated Hydroxytolue) : so toxic it’s already been banned in many other countries. In the US, it’s often used as a preservative in chewing gum and other processed foods. BHT has been linked to organ system toxicity, including kidney and liver damage, hyperactivity in children and may be carcinogenic.<br /><br />Calcium Casein Peptone (Calcium Phosphate): Found primarily in Trident gum, it’s thought this ingredient may be used as a whitening agent or texturizer. As a highly processed milk derivative, little is known about its long-term ingestion, although casein was previously linked to baby formula poisonings in China.<br /><br />Gum Base: It’s quite a mystery what “gum base” is actually made out of, but the investigators found it’s usually a blend of elastomers, resins, plasticizers and fillers. Most manufacturers do not reveal more specifics than this. After all, why would they want you to know that you’re potentially chewing on petroleum-derived paraffin wax, polyvinyl acetate (carpenter’s glue) and talc, which is linked to cancer.<br /><br />Titanium Dioxide:often used as a whitening agent in chewing gum, but it’s been linked to autoimmune disorders, asthma, and Crohn’s disease and is potentially carcinogenic. Onestudy found children are highly exposed to titanium dioxide in confections, with chewing gum containing the highest levels.2\n",

            "Review: I give a three star review for Katz bakery for the following reasons. In the winter this is a 5 star bakery and shipping service. In the warmer weather you are taking a real risk. 0 stars after April in NY. Here is why, the bakery does not include cold packs. The food is shipped frozen and allowed to defrost in transit. I did not take the other reviewers concerns seriously enough and wanted to write a detailed explaination so others could make the best purchase for their needs.<br />I contacted Katz and AMAZON about an a problem, both AMAZON and Katz offered me a refund, Katz actually refunded the entire order and reshipped some items to me! All offered excellent customer service!!!!! 5 stars to Katz and AMAZON for their customer service in dealing with my issue.<br />The tastiest and easiest/quickest to defrost and eat are Katz's Powdered and Cinnamon Donuts-I will order them again and again. I do love the glazed-I recommend letting them sit out until they defrost and the glaze hardens again, about 3 to 4 hours. The Custard filled donuts are extremely tasty so good, like a zeppoli filled with Boston Cream. The Jelly donuts are inconsistent-some will not have any jelly-true story. The pies must be baked, I haven't tried them yet. The Rugehlah were not my favorite. The cinnamon rolls-these everyone could could tell were a gluten free item and best eaten hot and quickly. All the donuts TASTE like real donuts. What. A. Treat. I will order these again in the cool weather. And I want to try the cupcakes.\n",

Some reviewers said it had a chemical taste,  I can sympathize with that, but the sharp, strong flavor of this candy (whatever it is) is bracing and welcome enough to easily finish the can.  Although, I probably will be sticking to their other great flavors in the future.\n",

            "Review: I am adult who loves freeze pops.  These are actually my favorite brand.  They taste the same as Warheads Extreme Freeze pops in flavor and level of sour.  The Sour Kool Pops are a better deal, 20 pops for $1.00 at the Dollar Tree.  Warheads are $1.00 for 10 pops.  Size wise they are probably about the same.  The warheads are shorter and thicker.  The Kool Pops are longer and thinner.  I suspect they both contain the same amount of liquid.  The cellophane wrapper is very thin on both products and you should freeze them before trying to separate them from each other.  After they are frozen separating them is not an issue, the wrapper doesn't tear.  I tried to separate prior to freezing (thought they would freeze faster individually) but the wrapper tore and spewed red water all over the place.  As far as level of &#34;sour&#34;.  They are tart but not offensively so.  If you do not like sour flavors I would not recommend them.  I on the other hand love sour stuff and these are the only pops that satisfy my desire for  a crisp, cold sour freeze pop.  I stocked up on them since the Dollar Store is the only place I've seen them and suspect they won't be available once Summer is over.  Excellent value, perfect for those who love sour pops.\n",

I finally decided to check Amazon and came across this light buckwheat flour.  I have been experimenting with recipes for the last 3 days, since this flour came.  I have to say, OMG!  This tastes amazing in all of the recipes I have tried so far.  We have tried calzones, pizza and onion rings so far.  The pizza crust is delicious.  There is no grainy after taste like there can be with a lot of GF flours.  It also made a crispy breading for the onion rings.

It's nice to actually eat boneless and skinless salmon for once.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is very pricey for what you get, even moreso considering it's not red salmon, which is far tastier (and healthier to boot).<br /><br />In addition to that, there was what I thought was glass shards in it, but it turns out it's some sort of crystal called Struvite.  What a shocker that was to bite into, and a bit of a ruiner of the product.<br /><br />Aside from the struvite, it's a really good product if you want skinless and boneless salmon.. though the price outweighs that benefit for me, so I won't be purchasing it again unless there's a big price drop in future.\n",

The beans arrived covered in oils, and had a nearly dark coating. Once ground, the beans are lighter than a dark roast - so it's the only upside I have for their profile, but due to the oils coming out of the beans, it will ultimately cause an uneven grind over time, and loss of quality in a quicker time frame. Next time, I'll be paying double for my Sulawesi coffee and order directly through &#34;The Chosen Bean&#34; whom has a medium roast profile that is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />If they roasted for a shorter period of time, this bean could very well be a 5 star ratings since the Toraja is a preferred bean for many home brewers.\n",

            "Review: Coffee Crazy's French Roast is made from organically grown Arabica specialty coffee beans that are sold at Fair Trade prices. The company is also part of the Rainforest Alliance. There is nothing complicated about these beans. They are organic, dark roasted and whole. The coffee comes in a 12 ounce for $13.95 on Amazon. This is about the average price for Organic and Fair Trade coffee beans.<br /><br />The whole beans are dark in color. They grind up nicely in my coffee grinder.<br /><br />USAGE: I brewed Coffee Crazy Organic French Roast using my 3 cup glass Chemex. I usually brew 2 spoonfuls of ground coffee per 1 cup of water. I like coffee strong. If you make the coffee and it's too strong, you can dilute by adding a little bit of hot water at a time until you reach your preferred strength.<br /><br />RESULTS: I poured up a small cup of the coffee and took a sip. The coffee was strong, bold and smooth. I really like the low acidity, especially since I prefer my coffee stronger and stronger causes sometimes irritates my stomach. I am able to drink a couple of small cups of this coffee throughout the day with no stomach irritation, so I know this coffee has low acidity. The caffeine content was just where I like it. The coffee woke me up without giving me too much of a &#34;caffeine buzz.&#34;.<br /><br />If you are looking for an organic French Roast blend that is Fair Trade and Rainforest Alliance certified, look to Coffee Crazy. I know you will go just as crazy over this coffee as I have!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received.

            "Review: In England, I only ever used loose tea. My mum would have had a fit if she'd known we were using PG Tips tea bags over here. We were recently lucky enough to find this loose tea in a nearby Indian grocery store (this size, 450g, @ $7.75). Oh, I'd forgotten what a nice refreshing cup of tea tasted like.  No bitterness, all taste, and so smooth. I bought a 32oz coffee press to make this tea in (not so keen on how it pours, but it brews a nice clean pot of tea). If only Amazon was more competitive on the pricing I would buy the 2-pack on subscribe and save, but currently they cannot beat the deal I got at the Indian grocer's. The best deal on Amazon is the bigger size also available with Prime shipping. Suggest getting a vacuum seal canister if you buy the large size to preserve the flavor/freshness.  If you tend to top up the pot with more hot water after the first pouring, I would suggest only topping up to half way or two-thirds at most unless you are ok with a weak second brew.\n",

The problem with most decaffeinated English breakfast tea is it's short on tea flavor and reminds me a great deal of cardboard.  This one, though, has a lot of flavor, slightly smoky, which I don't mind at all, and tastes great with a squeeze of lemon.  I don't like sugar or any kind of sweetener in my tea and I really dislike milk in tea.  So I'm judging this tea unsweetened, without milk, and just a bit of lemon in it and I think it's excellent.  Since the tea bags are not individually sealed in small pouches, the tin they come in is a good thing as to keeping air out and preserving the tea flavor while sitting in my cupboard.\n",

It is a somewhat dryer rice, but I really enjoyed this rice. It has more of a bite to it and liked the fragrance that was coming out of the rice cooker while cooking. It was a great match to eat with any protein, but I usually prefer chicken and rice. I added a little sauce on the rice and it absorbs the sauce well without making it &#34;Wet&#34;.

            "Review: My husband and I occasionally buy energy drinks, more so him, than I, but we both drink them. Most energy drinks we get give me the shakes unless I drink them on a very full stomach. I enjoy the boost of energy they give me, but not the shaking. So lately we have cut way back. When I was given the opportunity to try these from BzzAgent, I was excited to try something new. These are great! Nothing like I had expected. They taste delicious and give you a little boost of energy and no shakes. My husband mentioned that he could drink these in the morning once in awhile, instead of coffee. They are small, so you can throw them in a bag or purse, but not too small. I like that I can drink it all in one sitting and not have to waste a lot because I can't finish it. Some other energy drinks are so large. Overall, I am happy with these drinks. They taste so much better than I had expected, plus there are several flavors to choose from. There is something for everyone.\n",

Excellent design 99.999%  cardboard or paper product.  The same per cent recyclable or biodegradable.  Also bottles are glass not plastic. Never had a broken bottle. All this to me shows a level of care, commitment to the environment, commitment to healthy packaging which encourages me to believe that this is a company culture which hopefully extends to the growing and processing of the vegetables that go into the juice. I frequently buy &#34;healthy&#34;  juice products that come in plastic bottles and plastic bubble wrap cushioning of some sort or glass bottles wrapped in smaller bubble bubble wrap.  To me this is a contradiction which does not encourage trust in the company or it's products.<br />--- Update 12/19/2016  --- no change in opinion of product - still five stars --- but priced way too high.  used to be able to buy around $28 now in the $40 minimum.

I wouldn't call it mild, more like 3.5/5 on the spicy meter. It's delicious - I have it with pretty much anything I can add it to, including eggs, sushi (don' judge me), fried rice and even a McChicken. I found this product having breakfast at a cute cabin on a road trip. My friends suggested I try it (with scrambled eggs) and I thought they were nuts, but it was delicious! I even took a picture of the bottle so I could find it again, I should add, I'm usually too lazy to go out of my way for products, but this was just that good. At first I was turned off from the shipping since I am a Prime member and have gotten used to not paying for shipping, but I think it's absolutely worth it. So if you're looking for a great staple hot sauce to add to the ketchup and mustard in your home, this it definitely it. Bon appetit!\n",

The chocolate coating on the bottom of the bar was very good and the hazelnuts were a nice treat, but I wanted more salty flavor and the orange zest didn't work for me.<br /><br />On the healthy side, this bar is mostly a good choice with ingredients you can pronounce: hazelnuts, almonds, sugar, Macadamia nuts, honey, palm kernel oil, tapioca syrup, cocoa powder, orange zest (orange peel, sugar, citric acid), sunflower lecithin, rice flour, vanilla extract, sea salt.

The meat came out nice and tender, with this sauce's flavor in it, and fact it was frozen added some liquid, so the gravy went further. I don't know how it works with thawed meat, but with frozen it worked wonderfully. The gravy is delicious: just a tiny bit sweet from the beer, but it complimented the elk really well. I'm pleased and will be getting  more packages to deal with more of the meat in my freezer.

            "Review: I received a single sample bar of this Food Should Taste Good Real Good Bar Hazelnut Sea Salt bar that traveled in a yellow envelope through some very hot weather and arrived here pretty much melted all over the wrapper. I put it in the frig for a couple hours before eating it. Thanks to the fact that it's made of whole Hazelnuts, Almonds and Macadamia Nuts, it recovered pretty well. The flavor is very good and not overly sweet. I particularly like the flavor of the added orange zest. It goes great with the chocolate. I also like that the label indicates that it is Non-GMO (Not made with any genetically engineered ingredients). I am much more likely to purchase Non-GMO products.<br /><br />They are made by the Food Should Taste Good Company which is owned by General Mills. They also make some creative type tortilla, flax chips, crackers and puffs under the same name.<br /><br />I like the bars because they contain lots of nuts and whole food ingredients rather than ingredients that are unrecognizable and all mashed together like in some bars. The spices are used creatively and are well balanced. They aren't overly sweet and there's enough natural fat in the nuts that they leave me feeling full for at least a couple hours after I eat them. And, of course, there's the chocolate that is kind of semi sweet. I LOVE chocolate. At 220 calories per bar it makes a good dessert. I will purchase these in the future.\n",

The taste is fine, not to sweet and not to tart, according to picky teen daughter (who refused to try the jerky sampler contents), for whom these were chosen.  No refrigeration is needed before opening, which make these a good choice for emergency food boxes.  They taste better than regular UHT shelf stable milk products, again likely due to the fruit content.<br /><br />Teen daughter says they taste fine, and taste great when refrigerated.  They are a little hard to squeeze out of the pouch while drinking.  When informed that a straw can be used, TD said, &#34;Oh, that makes sense).  She liked that she was able to get protein, calcium, and some fruit without having to chew carefully so as not to damage her orthodontia.<br /><br />Would I get these again?

It also had banners and giant photos on the wall of hot women with their tongues out licking lollipops and other candy. I was just about as sensual as you can get without being x-rated and it was HOT. VERY hot store. Anyway, the concept was a bit odd but like I said sensual. Could easily have been a Victoria Secret store but with candy. So I purchased some awesome old time names like those Abba-Zaba. Now I will be getting them on Amazon because they are so delicious. I might just go back to that store but its an hour away. They also had shirts that said things like &#34;it's NOT going to lick itself.&#34; LOL, I used to say that to my girlfriend when she was having that time of the month. Anyway, Im ordering more of these. Also the MaryJanes are old and delicious too if you remember them. My grandparents had them all over the house. Amazon is amazing I buy everything on here. Enjoy.

I typically drink regular Lipton hot tea which I use 2-3 tea bags for extra flavor and kick.  I prepared and drank my usual 2 or 3 tea bags of Stash Super Irish Breakfast.  To my supprise, the Stash &#34;Super&#34; Irish Breakfast does not have as much flavor as Lipton and it does not seem to equal the caffeine content.  I have had other Irish Breakfast and English breakfast teas with superb flavors, but this does not come close.  Will not be reordering.

I want my veggies clean but I also don't want to waste a gallon of water to do it. I spray my leafy greens, toss/mix them to coat with solution, then soak in water for a few minutes. Once the suds die down I'll give them a final rinse. For fruits, I spray and rub then rinse, and though bubbles aren't a problem it does take a bit of water to fully rinse them clean of solution. My mom also says she can taste the solution on things like corn and blackberries, even after a thorough rinse.\n",

I added two tsp of sugar and a splash of creme and it was still bitter maybe I'll try it with milk and see how that goes. This coffee just was not for me. I think it tasted like what I expect chain restaurants to serve not very flavorful bittter and dark. I am picky with my coffee even if I am not an expert I just like very few. So I asked my mom to try it she stated that it tasted burnt. With coffee everyone has there own preferance so it is always good to try yourself this one is just not for me maybe a different blend would be better for me since the beans them self seem to be in good condidtion.

While it is not as bold/dark as some brands/blends, it has a rich, smooth flavor with almost no bitterness -- and I drink my coffee black.  If you like a bite to your bold blend, the Dark and Handsome will likely disappoint, but if you like a smoother cup, then definitely give this a try.<br /><br />Although I do not own a Keurig 2.0 and therefore cannot speak to its ability to circumvent the &#34;approved&#34; K-cup feature, I do know that purple/pink can fool it.  These have a purplish-pink ring around them and should work.  Since I don't like many Green Mountain brews, the work-around should be worth it for this and other blends.<br /><br />This blend is perfect for those who don't like their bold coffee to be too strong -- that is, those who like full but not intense flavor.

I mostly wanted to use this to cover up the flavor of some hemp protein I was trying out.  And it was very good at that.<br /><br />First of all, this smells lovely when you open the bag.  The powder is finely milled and non clumpy.  I did have a bit of trouble getting the bag reclosed and had to store it in a zip-top plastic freezer bag.  (The bag is supposed to be reclosable.)  I would not say this totally dissolved in almond milk, but one tablespoon of this in 6 ounces of almond milk worked quite well and was non gritty.  (Blend with an immersion blender or hand mixer if you are going to use the cacao powder this way.)  This is not sweetened (in fact, it has only one ingredient) so be aware of that.  This is free of a lot of allergens but is processed in a facility that uses soy and tree nuts, so watch out for that as well, if it is of concern to you.<br /><br />This is quite dark in color so theoretically, it should have a lot of antioxidants (or, at the very least, it is quite fresh).  This is really low in calories and I love that it has a bit of fiber -- protein smoothies frequently lack a lot of fiber and by adding a tablespoon of this, you'll easily increase your daily fiber intake.  It also works well in combination with artificial sweeteners if you want a chocolate fix and are trying to decrease your sugar intake.  A tablespoon or two would be a good addition to a variety of baked goods; just watch the proportions at first to make sure you won't be changing the texture very much.<br /><br />In the end, if you are looking for a cacao product for the health benefits, this is a great one to try due to the large amount of product you get (this is currently priced competitively) and the deep, dark color.<br /><br />Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.\n",

            "Review: No fancy packaging or foil stickers. The container won't impress your snooty friends, but this is one of the best coffees I've ever tasted. If you like a rich, deep roast you'll like Folgers Gourmet Supreme. Perfect breakfast coffee, smooth with no bitterness. You won't have to measure an extra tablespoon or two to satisfy you. Just consistently good cup after cup. I remember when my Mom made Folgers in an electric percolator (some of you may not know what that is). They've been around awhile (even before percolators) and they know coffee. Oh and the container suits me just fine. That indentation on the side allows you to grip it while you're opening the lid. Clever, really. I'd like to share a funny anecdote. I received some kitchen storage containers that I ordered to organize my pantry. They were advertised as &#34;airtight&#34;. Ha! I called customer service for a refund and put my staples in empty Folgers containers (until I find good ones) because their lids ARE airtight and the coffee stays fresh. Great deal finding my favorite coffee in bulk.\n",

They are refreshing , makes a great mixer for alcoholic beverage drinks entertaining your guests and most importantly, it taste GREAT and fights UTI's as a bonus! Amazon delivered this exceptionally well, they were wrapped by the original manufacturer plastic wrap to ensure a tight and secure packaging to give a peace of mind they won't spill or open before delivery. I will try to upload a picture of the product.<br /><br />On a serious note...lately I been using Amazon Subscribe and Save more and more and more for my grocery needs and couldn't be happier with their service. Purchasing 5 ore more S&S items will increase the discount from 5% to 15% and usually get delivered once a month to your door.

I wouldn't eat them in the condition their in, but they will be good for planting, and the new generation should be better.<br /><br />I wouldn't get these again, only because of the condition they were in, and the price for half isn't worth it<br /><br />****Update****<br /><br />As of 8/15/15 im changing my review to ONE star. This product was absolutely horrible. It turns out, my remaining 6 pieces of cane was also infected with Red Root Rot. I ended up calling amazon to complain. They were very kind about it and sent an email to the distributor and within 24-48 hours i received my money back, less the S&H.<br /><br />I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially for the cost. Go to Ebay where they provide current pictures of the cane, for half the price. If you had a bad experience, i would also contact amazon and complain so you can get your money back. Maybe if enough people complain, they will stop sending infected, rotted, diseased Cane.\n",
